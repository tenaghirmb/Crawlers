Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold
]I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin¡® on holdin¡® on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so
I don't understand why you're so cold
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breath
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl I tried to give you space
Baby tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold





If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you
Oh now please don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if I knew love was in vain
So I hope you'll see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if I knew love was in vain
So I hope you'll see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you
  
I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back

I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
(Yeah)
So this is goodbye

God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what you¡¯re going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye

I¡¯ve been here before
One day a week
And it won¡¯t hurt anymore

You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don\'t have a meaning
Cause

I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder

And I...and so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye

(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah

  it's so hard to find you
i'm standing right behind you
the streets are much colder
this mean i'm getting older
why would you? how could i?
these questions lead to goodbye
but now i got my freedom
don't i?
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
shy girl, so humble
with eyes that make me stumble
somehow not speaking lets me know everything
i go out, you eat in
hot from the situation
you're naked in daylight
wrap yourself up and goodnight
i'm burning, i'm hungry
angry cuz she don't love me
you got me completely
in my own game you beat me
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified i think that i may be losing my mind
i will be back again
no this is not the end
i've fallen hard this time but i not giving in
i want the world to know that i won't let you forget
the tears that you shed
i'll make it impossible to let go
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a place to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
Maroon 5 - Nothing Lasts Forever


It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I£§m letting go
It may not last but I don£§t know
Just don£§t know

If you don£§t know
Then you can£§t care
And I show up
But you£§re not there
But I£§m waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

A babe that£§s warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving all he makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It won£§t fall down while I£§m asleep
If you don£§t know
Then you can£§t care
And I show up
But you£§re not there
But I£§m waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn£§t mean we£§re not still falling, oh
I want for mine to pick you up
But you£§re still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame, I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way


END
I asked her to stay but she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
Oh
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight

Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of your breath, I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake
Oh
The weight of things that remain unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight


Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you (Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh

It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you(Hooooo)

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you

  Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
she will be loved
She will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
It's all right, It's all right
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
  I didn't hear what you were saying
 I live on raw emotion, baby
 I answer questions, never maybe
 And I'm not kind if you betray me
 So who the hell are you to say 'we'?
 I never would've made it, baby
 
 If you needed love, well, then ask for love
 Could've given love, now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
 What's coming now, so don't say a word
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore?
 Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
 
 Six foot tall, came without a warning
 So I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here, I don't think so!
 
 I would've bled to make you happy
 You didn't need to treat me that way
 And now you've beat me at my own game
 And now I found you sleeping soundly
 And your love is screaming loudly
 I hear a sound and hit the ground
 
 If you needed love, well, then ask for love
 Could've given love, now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
 What's coming now, so don't say a word
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore?
 Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
 
 Six foot tall, came without a warning
 So I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here, I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad
 
 I'm so sorry, darling
 Did I do the wrong thing?
 Oh, what was I thinking?
 Is his heart still beating?
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore?
 Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
 
 Six foot tall, came without a warning
 So I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here, I don't feel so bad
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore?
 Care about me? I don't think so!
 
 Six foot tall, came without a warning
 So I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore?
 Don't you care about me? I don't feel so bad
 
 Wake up call, caught you in the morning
 With another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore? 

Wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
Way it felt to hearing lies
Pleasure that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath,after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have reason
And you don't have time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
£¨Yeah£©
So this is goodbye
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
Want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind,make your move
Forget about the truth

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning
Cause
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you and I
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feelin
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye £¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye £¨Oh no£©

So this is goodbye
  when  you  refuse  me

what  makes  you  think  i'll  let  you  in  again?
think  again  my  friend
go  on  misuse  me  and  abuse  me
i'll  come  out  stronger  in  the  end

you  won't  find  me 'cause  i'm  not  coming  home
you  do  not  know  how  much  this  hurts  me
to  say  these  things  that  i  don't  want  to  say
but  have  to  say  them  anyway
i  would  do  anything  to  end  your  suffering
but  you  would  rather  walk  away

  I'm sick of picking the pieces
 And second-guessing
 My reasons why you don't trust me
 Why must we do this to one another?
 We are just passionate lovers
 With trouble under the covers
 Nothing worse than when
 You know that it's over
 
 I just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To say the words I never said
 Just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To show you that I am not dead
 
 Please don't leave, stay in bed
 Touch my body instead
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 
 Well I've got nothing to hide
 Dip down and come for a ride
 I'm racing the devil, so sly
 You cannot hear him coming
 'Cause my defences are weak
 I have no breath left to speak
 So take my evidence
 And bury it somewhere
 
 I just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To say the words I never said
 Just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To show you that I am not dead
 
 Please don't leave, stay in bed
 Touch my body instead
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 
 Oh my, I don't mind
 Being the other guy
 Nice try, for these games
 I do not have the time
 If you want me, call me
 Come and take a risk (kiss)
 Leave somewhere deep under the surface
 I just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To say the words I never said
 Just need a little of your time
 A little of your time
 To show you that I am not dead
 
 Please don't leave, stay in bed
 Touch my body instead
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it?
 Gonna make you feel it
 Can you still feel it? 

Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I¡¯m not your type
But I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn
You¡¯re not the only one
I\'d let you be if you
put down your blazing gun
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It¡¯s hard not to give in
I¡¯m lost, I can¡¯t tell
Where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn
You¡¯re with another man
I wonder if he¡¯s half
The lover that I am
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else Far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight

Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don¡¯t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we got much further than I thought we\'d get tonight

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let it go
Oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it
Oh, no they can't
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you, "How hot can it get?"
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, "I'm not there yet."
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it
Oh, no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, but can they keep it
Oh, no they can't

Sunday morning £¬rain is falling
Steal some covers £¬share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
£¨Someday£©
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh..yeah.But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
£¨life gets hard to do£©
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, Someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
May not know that may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow......
I am a flower in your hair
I am a flower in your hair
Maroon 5
Through With You
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it
...
And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well
Oh Oh
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
...
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you?
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
...
You ain't ever coming back to me

¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
Sometimes you move so well
It¡¯s hard not to give in
I¡¯m lost, I can¡¯t tell
Where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn
You¡¯re with another man
I wonder if he¡¯s half
The lover that I am
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else Far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don¡¯t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we got much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
  Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
You come back
And I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Feel
Feel
Feel

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Show you how I feel
Show you how I feel
Show you how, show you, show you
Show you how I feel
  Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type
But I can make you stay
It makes you burn to learn
You're not the only one
I left you be a field
Put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you £¨find you find you£©

  After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes its a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
The rhythm of the conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
Said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sunThe Sun

The Sun
You build me up 
You knock me down 
Provoke a smile 
And make me frown 
You are the queen of runaround 
You know it's true 
You chew me up 
And spit me out 
Enjoy the taste 
I leave in your mouth 
You look at me 
I look at you 
Neither of us know what to do 
There may not 
Be another way to your heart 
So I guess I'd better find a new way in 
I shiver when I hear your name 
Think about you but it's not the same 
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin 
Immobilized by the thought of you 
Paralyzed by the sight of you 
Hypnotized by the words you say 
Not true but I believe 'em anyway 
So come to bed, it's getting late 
There's no more time for us to waste 
Remember how my body tastes 
You feel your heart begin to race 
There may not 
Be another way to your heart 
So I guess I'd better find the new way in 
I shiver when I hear your name 
Think about you but it's not the same 
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin 
Feel your heart begin to race 
There may not 
Be another way to your heart 
So I guess I'd better find a new way in 
And I shiver when I hear your name 
Think about you but it's not the same 
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin 
There may not 
Be another way to your heart 
So I guess I'd better find the new way in 
And I shiver when I hear your name 
Think about you but it's not the same 
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
Cause everytime you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two
Do you
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you
I ain't never coming back to you
Sunday morning £¬rain is falling
Steal some covers £¬share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
£¨Someday£©
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh..yeah.But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
£¨life gets hard to do£©
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, Someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
May not know that may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow......
Cross a flower in your hair
Cross a flower in your hair
  Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her everytime she falls
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
I tried so hard to say good-bye
  I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you ve never said
Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I looking was for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen cry to you
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city s made us crazy and we must get out
This not goodbye she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed
Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city s made us crazy and we must get out
There s only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city  made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city  made us crazy and we must get out
whoa
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city made us crazy and we must get out

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable

So condescending, unnecessarily critical

I have the tendency of getting very physical

So watch your step cause
if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder
why I'm even here

The double-vision I was seeing is finally clear

You want to stay but you know very well
I want you gone
Not fit to funkin' tread the ground
that I am walking on

When it gets cold outside

and you got nobody to love

You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up

And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
that lives in her dreams

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things
up inside my head
You should know better
you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow
and writhing in a naked sweat

Hoping somebody
someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside

and you got nobody to love

You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up

And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
that lives in her dreams

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill?
Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?

Does it thrill?
Does it sting?
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love

You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up

And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster
that lives in her dreams

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Is there anyone out there
cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
I'm full of regret
For all things that I've done and said
And I don't know if it'll ever be ok to show
My face 'round here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever turn your head and look
See if I'm gone
Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Your just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin after anything that I can get
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
It's all right, It's all right
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
Shiver

  You've been bad' and it goes on and on and on
Till you come home babe' Till you come home
You taste past the poison' you learn to love has gone
I'm all alone baby' I'm all alone
I'm waiting for something' always waiting
Feeling nothing' wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more' oh babe
Oh give a little more' oh babe
I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby

You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

Feeling nothing' wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more' oh babe

I'm sure that he could give you everything

Stability and diamond rings

All the things I do not have

I understand you can't handle that

But for everything that I lack

I provide something you almost had

Half flesh that you yearn that grab

Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

So oh, what you gonna do

I'm in love with you

Don't you wanna dance

This may be the last chance

That I get to love you, oh oh oh

Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine

Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
I could give you so much more
So oh, what you gonna do.
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh
You don't make it easy to bring myself a safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive
So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you had
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
cause it's the only place you'll see my face
So oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
won't you wanna dance
This might be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
To love you, oh oh oh


People never change, they seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes but play the same games
Many different ways to say the same thing
Searching for the right words, the ones that would make you stay
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be, yeah
And choosing these words is saying to her
The things that she never heard but always deserved
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything, the air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
Oh, I'm not even really sure who made this mess
And who threw what punch but I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here and you are not, oh
Once I put this wasted pride aside, nothing's all I got, oh
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be, yeah
And choosing theses words is saying to her
The things that she never heard but always deserved
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything, the air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
Oh, somebody make it stop, yeah
And pick me up, and just dust me off, oh
The rainy day flood will drown all this love
Trapped at the bottom now, please dig me up
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything, the air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything, the air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
yeahh...
oh...
some people live for the fortune
some people live for the fame
some people live for the power yeah
some people live just to play the game
some people think that the physical things
define what's within

i've been there before
but that life's a bore
so full of the superficial
some people want it all
but i don't want at nothing all
if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you
some people search for a fountain
promises forever young
some people need three dozen roses

and that's the only way to prove you love them
and in a world on a silver platter
and wondering what it means
no one to share' no one who truly cares for me
some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all

if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you
some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all

if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you
if i ain't got you with me baby
nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
if i ain't got you with me baby
  

You push me,
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down, take me down

You hurt me,
But do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down

So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So you say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it
I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud
Can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake
But you can't forget

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

You say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all£¬Take all that I have
Take it, take it all£¬Take all that I have





Didn't hear what you were saying
Live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
So I'm not kind if you betray me
So, who the hell are you to save me
Never would have made it, babe
If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here
I don't think so, yeah
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing
Oh, what was I thinking
Is his heart still beating
Whoa, oh, oh
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
Bad...
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
Bad...
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
Yeah...
  

You say you need someone
But everybody does
I£§m no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who£§re only tryin£§ to help

As it£§s winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I£§ll see this through
There£§s so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

5,4,3,2,1
I won£§t stop until it£§s done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We£§ve been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all

I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I£§m fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

As it£§s winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I£§ll see this through
There£§s so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

5,4,3,2,1
I won£§t stop until it£§s done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We£§ve been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossin and turnin, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep,you£§re in too deep

5,4,3,2,1
I won£§t stop until it£§s done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We£§ve been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all
5,4,3,2,1
I won£§t stop until it£§s done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We£§ve been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all



I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Half flesh that you yearn that grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad
So oh, what you gonna do.
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more
So oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh
You don't make it easy to bring myself a safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive
So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you had
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
cause it's the only place you'll see my face
So oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
won't you wanna dance
This might be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
To love you, oh oh oh
Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt

Clothes on the bed, so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door

On our way home I realise

There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes

Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

Cos we're out of goodbyes

We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same about me

I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man
On our way home I realise

There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes

Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time

I need to move on and I need you to try

Cos we're out of goodbyes

We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes

  Oh yeah
Oh yeah

So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
I'm the way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
I'm not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting here
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
  I watched u cry bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
U said u wished u did not love me anymore
U left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine' no sunshine
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even done
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
Cuz I can't believe that it's over
U've hit your low
U've lost control' u won't come back
U may not believe me but I gave u all I had
Oh just confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears I
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine' no sunshine
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even done
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
No I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
So much to say it's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems and stare right thru my eyes
And in that darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
No I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
No I can't believe that it's over No I can't believe that it's over
  Get Back in My Life
Maroon 5

You are relentless, I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?

You keep me senseless, I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I'll fall into the darkness,
it's impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

Beauty from many, you're so demanding
But I've got time, I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect, completely worthy
You got my back against my wall

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I fall into the darkness,
impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free (yeah)
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Running back to you, running back to you
Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life,
come knock

I'll never leave you alone

  I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone
I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
Took you for granted
When you lifted me up
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now
Don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man-be-a-woman now
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up
Took you for granted
When you lifted me up
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?
Why must we be so ugly
And please do not stick up on me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to die
Why?
Why?
Why?
I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
  Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn't pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe your pain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it's just not there
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation £¨I want it¡­£©
Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
Now her face is something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation £¨I want it¡­£©
I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeh
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation £¨I want it¡­£©
Ooh £¨I want it¡­£©
Yeh¡­ £¨I want it¡­£©
Infatuation £¨Bonus Track£©

I'm happy you came to me first
before the bubble burst
i'm happy you answered my calls
i'm bouncing off the walls
impossible to be tamed
her need- celophane
i'm happy you like to play games
why did you run away?
we could spend some time together
what he had he'll never know
your boyfriend gives you no respect
and i can see your getting it
so lets figure it out let's go.
i'm happy you're so impulsive
means that your passionate
im happy you're moving so fast
but will it ever last
I know you wanna break free
from this monotony
i'm happy you're coming with me
but by choice its gotta be
we can spend some time together
what he has he'll never know
so figure it out lets go
I'm happy you're changing your speed
slow down and lay with me
on bottom but always discrete
kneel down and kiss her feet
i'm happy your going too far
full strength before we start
sometimes you make it so hard
scream loud as we come apart
figure it out lets go
figure it out lets
go

Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was
I tried and tried and tried and tried
But i have no concept of consequence
And i'm a master of self defence
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe
I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When i need you around
And i'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far i get without you
Desperately need more of your
....
  it's so hard to find you
i'm standing right behind you
the streets are much colder
this mean i'm getting older
why would you? how could i?
these questions lead to goodbye
but now i got my freedom
don't i?
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
shy girl, so humble
with eyes that make me stumble
somehow not speaking lets me know everything
i go out, you eat in
hot from the situation
you're naked in daylight
wrap yourself up and goodnight
i'm burning, i'm hungry
angry cuz she don't love me
you got me completely
in my own game you beat me
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified i think that i may be losing my mind
i will be back again
no this is not the end
i've fallen hard this time but i not giving in
i want the world to know that i won't let you forget
the tears that you shed
i'll make it impossible to let go
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday you'll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a place to be alone
i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
  Until You're Over Me
Maroon 5

This relationship is over,
though my stomach still hurts.

And now I'm gonna live alone,
Why is the pain much worse?

You're so much better without makeup,
Why would you hide your face?

Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize I've made a big mistake.

ohhh...
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
I pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

I never meant to keep you waiting,
and now your food is getting cold,

I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.

And now you stand up from the table,
And say you never look back.

do something stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad.

ohhh...
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts soo much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

No more kisses on your lips, tender touch or speach...

I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.

And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be??

And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I dont care.

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I dont care.

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

  Maroon5-MissYouLoveYou
this has not been easy
this has been hard
i am scarred
and i do not know what to do with you.
go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
grab your hips, cant remember why i fell in love with this.
i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
oh no
you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
oh no
i dont need you
who do you think you are?
no one cares about a name without a face,
so dont go shooting up the place
make no mistake the loves not real
cause the love that i got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
oh no
you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
oh no
cause i dont need you tonight
it was really nice to know you
but, theres nothing left to show you
i got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
and even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...
i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
oh no
you beg me you ask me
to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
oh no, i dont need you
and i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
oh no
you beg me, you ask me to
kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
oh no, i dont need you
Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar,
That only I have seen.
Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried,
said that it was all for me.
And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true,
It comes true.
Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Were you burn by the things I£§ve said?
Took the dive just to feel alive,
but never heard the truth.
Now I£§m in love but I don£§t know how
I£§m in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close,
I slowly open mine.
And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true.
I am so confused by this.
I know that life is hit or miss.
Days are stung by too much sun,
I think that you may be the one.
Cover yourself up in me,
Shrouded in what could have been.
I will listen to your pain,
if you listen to me.
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes True,
Comes true,
True,
It comes true,
True.
I want you know that everything I ever do is for you.
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
I can't seem to find
The pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay
And she got up and ran away
Well now, I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
All over me
So come down off your cloud
Say it now, say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make my day
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
All over me
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
  You've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
Till you come home babe, Till you come home
You taste past the poison, you learn to love has gone
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more, oh babe
Oh give a little more, oh babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby
Oh
Get a little more from you baby
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more, oh babe
Oh
Give a little more, oh babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby
Oh
Get a little more from you baby
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
And I cannot pretend
I ever want to feel this way again
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till i get a little more from you baby
Oh
Get a little more from you baby
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till i get a little more from you baby
Oh
Get a little more from you baby
  Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
I'm the way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
I'm not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting here
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
  I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on her hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye too many times before
  So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send

Gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
  You push me,
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down, take me down
You hurt me,
But do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So you say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it
I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud
Can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake
But you can't forget
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
  Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control

Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone

Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over, oh no

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone

I'm putting myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why she will not talk to me

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone





If I be so inclined to climb up beside you,
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I ever find the key you hide so well,
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leaving your smell on my coat,leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Yeah,Ooooh
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen.
Leaving your clothes on my floor,making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Ooooh
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burned me,I am screaming out for more.
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open,spill me out on to the floor.
Leaving your smell on my coat,leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand,fail to understand.
Leaving your smell on my coat,Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Yeah.Ooooh.
  i never knew perfection til
i heard you speak, and now it kills me
just to hear you say the simple things
now waking up is hard to do
and sleeping is impossible too
everything is reminding me of you
what can i do?
it's not right, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break¡­
a fool to let you slip away
i chase you just to hear you say
you're scared and that you think that i'm insane
the city look so nice from here
pity i can't see it clearly
while you're standing there, it disappears
it disappears
it's not right, not ok
say the word it should say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break
so you sitting all alone
you're fragile and you're cold, but that's all right
life these days is getting rough
they've knocked you down and beat you up
but it's just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah
it's not right, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break, baby

^_^
Ooh¡­

Danced all night slept all day
Kill us with my heart again
Feelings when it comes to playing games

You don't cry and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair

Is that your ghost or are you really there

Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
Ooh oh

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down I wish you'd stayed
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
Mmm
I try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me now
That's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you want
And I will be just fine

You'll be better off alone at night

Waiting falling

Constantly calling out your name

Will it ever change
Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me now
That's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
Ohh ooh
^_^
  You left me hanging from a thread
We once were from together

I lick my wounds but I can
Never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were ran with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behaviour
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged oh
I'm sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl

It's beyond me I cannot carry

The weight of a heavy world

So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah

Whoa oh

The room was silent as we
All tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged oh

I'm sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl

It's beyond me I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

Goodnight hope that things work out all right
So much to love
So much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you oh
I know I can be closed
But I try my best to reach you
I'm so sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl

It's beyond me I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world

So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah
Whoa oh¡­Yeah¡­
  Maroon 5 - Little of Your
I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said

Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it

Well I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
I'm racing the devil so sly
You cannot hear him coming
'Cause my defences are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take my evidence
And bury it somewhere
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Oh my I don't mind
Being the other guy
Nice try for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me call me
Come and take a risk £¨kiss£©
Leave somewhere deep under the surface

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it

  Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I¡¯m not your type
But I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn
You¡¯re not the only one
I'd let you be if you

How  dare  you  say  that  my  behavior's  unacceptable
So  condescending  unnecessarily  critical
I  have  the  tendency  of  getting  very  physical
So  watch  your  step  cause  if  I  do  you'll  need  a  miracle
You  drain  me  dry  and  make  me  wonder  why  I'm  even  here
The  double  vision  I  was  seeing  is  finally  clear
You  want  to  stay  but  you  know  very  well  I  want  you  gone
Not  fit  to  fuckin  tread  the  ground  I  am  walking  on
When  it  gets  cold  outside  and  you  got  nobody  to  love
You'll  understand  what  I  mean  when  I  say  there's  no  way  we're  gonna  give  up
and  like  a  little  girl  that  cries  in  the  face  of  a  monster  that  lives  in  her  dreams
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
What  you  are  doing  is  screwing  things  up  inside  my  head
You  should  know  better  you  never  listened  to  a  word  I  said
Clutching  your  pillow  and  writhing  in  a  naked  sweat
Hoping  somebody  someday  will  do  you  like  I  did
When  it  gets  cold  outside  and  you  got  nobody  to  love
You'll  understand  what  I  mean  when  I  say  there's  no  way  we're  gonna  give  up
and  like  a  little  girl  that  cries  in  the  face  of  a  monster  that  lives  in  her  dreams
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
Does  it  kill
Does  it  burn
Is  it  painful  to  learn  that  it's  me  that  has  all  the  control
Does  it  thrill
Does  it  sting
When  you  feel  what  I  bring  and  you  wish  you  had  me  to  hold
When  it  gets  cold  outside  and  you  got  nobody  to  love
You'll  understand  what  I  mean  when  I  say  there's  no  way  we're  gonna  give  up
and  like  a  little  girl  that  cries  in  the  face  of  a  monster  that  lives  in  her  dreams
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
Is  there  anyone  out  there  cause  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  to  breathe
  beauty queen of only eighteen she
had some trouble with herself
he was always there to help her
she always belonged to someone else
i drove for miles and miles
and wound up at your door
i've had you so many times but somehow
i want more
i don't mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile
and she will be loved
and she will be loved
tap on my window, knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful
i know i tend to get so insecure
it doesn't matter anymore
it's not always rainbows and butterflies
it's compromise that moves us along
my heart is full and my door's always open
you can come anytime you want
i don't mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile
and she will be loved

out on your corner
in the pouring rain, oh
i don't mind spending every day
out on your corner
in the pouring rain, oh
  I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on her hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye too many times before

  This has not been easy
this has been hard
I am scarred
and I do not know what to do with you.
go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
grab your hips, cant remember why i fell in love with this.
but i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time cause oh no
you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again cause oh no
i dont need you
Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face,
so dont go shooting up the place
make no mistake the loves not real
cause the love that i got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
i dont need you tonight
it was really nice to know you
but, theres nothing left to show you
i got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
and even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...
i miss you, i love you
you beg me you ask me
to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
cause oh no, i dont need you
and i miss you, i love you
you beg me, you ask me to
cause oh no, I dont need you tonight
  It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older
Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind
Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, You eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry cuz she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me
I'm terrified I think that I may be losing my mind
I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go
I finally found a place to be alone
  Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type
But I can make you stay
It makes you burn to learn
You're not the only one
I left you be a field
Put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you £¨find you find you£©
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you £¨right behind you£©
Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again
I don't mind
Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in
I'm lost I can't tell
Where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn
You're with another man
I wonder if he's half
The lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you £¨find you find you£©
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you £¨right behind you£©
Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again
I don't mind
Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
Baby baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
£¨Promise not to leave me behind£©
Take me back but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Talk to me by taking your time
£¨Talk to me talk to me£©
Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind'Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
Keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again
I don't mind
Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen
Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me
And be near just for the moment
Stay here never go home
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true It comes true
Have you leared all the secrets yet?
Were you burned by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
And I'm in pain cause I want it now
And as I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine
Be near just for the moment
Stay here, never go home
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true comes true
I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one
Cover yourself up in me
Shrounded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes
As the story of a broken heart comes true
Did you know
That everything she ever does is for you?
And I know
As the story of a broken heart comes true comes true
True, it comes true, true
  I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
(Yeah)
So this is goodbye
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you¡¯re going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
I¡¯ve been here before
One day a week
And it won¡¯t hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don\'t have a meaning
Cause
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
And I...and so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
£¨Someday£©
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh..yeah..but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
£¨life gets hard to do£©
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you..yeah..
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
May not know that may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow......
Cross a flower in your hair
Cross a flower in your hair
  Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I¡¯m not your type
But I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn
You¡¯re not the only one
I\'d let you be if you
put down your blazing gun
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)

  baby, i don't want to spend my life on trial
for something that i did not do
and maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
i wouldn't pass right by you
maybe it's because you are so insecure

maybe your pain don't care

maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
i fall so when it's just not there

burn another bridge, break another heart
try again, it will only fall apart
infatuation

not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
it's such a shame that you shot me down
it would have been nice to be around
i'm touching your skin
if it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
i guess this must be infatuation £¨i want it¡­£©
try to put my finger on what burns me up
it always seems to escape me
and when you have decided that you've had enough
just tell me where i need to be
now her face is something that i never had
to ever deal with before
she left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
and i'm the one wanting more
burn another bridge, break another heart
try again, it will only fall apart
infatuation

not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
it's such a shame that you shot me down
it would have been nice to be around
i'm touching your skin
if it's only a  fantasy, then why is it killing me?
and i guess this must be infatuation £¨i want it¡­£©
i'm so attracted to you
the feeling's mutual too
and i get scared the moment you leave
get so hot i forget to breathe, yeh
infatuation

not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
it's such a shame that you shot me down
it would have been nice to be around

i'm touching your skin
if it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
i guess this must be infatuation £¨i want it¡­£©
ooh £¨i want it¡­£©
yeh¡­£¨i want it¡­£©
  i never knew perfection til
i heard you speak, and now it kills me
just to hear you say the simple things
now waking up is hard to do
and sleeping is impossible too
everything is reminding me of you
what can i do?
it's not right, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break¡­
a fool to let you slip away
i chase you just to hear you say
you're scared and that you think that i'm insane
the city look so nice from here
pity i can't see it clearly
while you're standing there, it disappears
it disappears
it's not right, not ok
say the word it should say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break
so you sitting all alone
you're fragile and you're cold, but that's all right
life these days is getting rough
they've knocked you down and beat you up
but it's just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah
it's not right, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we're better off this way?
i'm not fine, i'm in pain
it's harder everyday
maybe we're better off this way?
it's better that we break, baby

And  so  do  I,I  empathise
I  see  you  out,you  never  care
A  conversation  that  we  never  share
But  it's  so  strange,it's  something  new
Amazing  feelings  that  I  have  for  you
I  close  my  eyes  when  I'm  alone
Wonder  what  it'd  be  like  to  make  you  moan
I  wanna  give  you  something  better
Than  anything  you've  ever  had
A  stronger  and  a  faster  lover
The  world  will  disappear  so  fast
Sweet  kiwi
Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
So  please,let  me
Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
So  give  it  up,and  don't  pretend
And  spread  your  arms  and  legs  across  the  bed
And  when  you  shake,you  won't  regret
The  things  I  whisper  in  your  ear
£¨What?£©I  said:
I  wanna  give  you  something  better
£¨You  wanna  give  me  something  better£©

Sweet  kiwi
Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
So  please,let  me
Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
I  can't  wait  to  take  you  home
Fingers  through  your  hair
Kisses  on  your  back
And  scratch  me  with  your  nails
Save  me  from  myself
Show  me  how  to  care
Get  everything  out
Dripping  everywhere
Lipstick  smeared  all  over  your  face
How  much  longer  must  we  wait?
¡­Don't  think  that  I  can  wait

Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
So  please,let  me

Ooh¡­

Danced all night slept all day
Kill us with my heart again
Feelings when it comes to playing games

You don't cry and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair

Is that your ghost or are you really there

Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
Ooh oh

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down I wish you'd stayed
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
Mmm
I try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me now
That's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you want
And I will be just fine

You'll be better off alone at night

Waiting falling

Constantly calling out your name

Will it ever change
Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me now
That's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
Ohh ooh
^_^
  You left me hanging from a thread
We once were from together
I lick my wounds but I can
Never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were ran with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behaviour
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged oh
I'm sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah
Whoa oh
The room was silent as we
All tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged oh
I'm sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight hope that things work out all right
So much to love
So much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you oh
I know I can be closed
But I try my best to reach you
I'm so sorry I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah
Whoa oh¡­Yeah¡­
  

Until You're Over Me
Maroon 5

This relationship is over,
though my stomach still hurts.
And now I'm gonna live alone,
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup,
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize I've made a big mistake.
ohhh...
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
I pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
I never meant to keep you waiting,
and now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.
And now you stand up from the table,
And say you never look back.
do something stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad.
And I pretend like I dont care.
It hurts soo much to know the truth,
No more kisses on your lips, tender touch or speach...
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be??
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
All alone in my room
think of you at a rate that is truly alarming

I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me

And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities

And I put myself at ease
by pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about your love

Ohh yeah

I can't believe I could think
that she would just follow me everywhere I go

I just wrestle with you in my dreams
and wake up making love to a pillow

And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities

And I put myself at ease
by pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go what do I do
And I can't stop and I can't stop
What I would give to have you look in my direction

And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention

And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind let me show you

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
  It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I'm letting go
It may not last but I don't know
Just don't know
If you don't know
Then you can't care
And I show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
A babe that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving all he makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It won't fall down while I'm asleep
If you don't know
Then you can't care
And I show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you babe
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling oh
I want for mine to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Everyday
With every word whispered we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
  I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say £¨oh£©
The words that were mend
 The things that were broken
 But now it's far too late she 's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking "why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath I'll never get over
And the noises that she made kept me awake (oh)
 The weight of things that remain unspoken
 Built up so much it crushed us everyday
Every night she cry yourself to sleep
Thinking "why does this happen to me£¿
 Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
 Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
Should not ever let you go oh oh oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you£¨oh£©
It's not over tonight
Just give me one chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
  I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to save me
I never would have made it babe
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here I don't think so
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly

And your lover's screaming loudly

I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here
I don't feel so bad I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry darling
Did I do the wrong thing
Oh what was I thinking
Is his heart still beating
Woah oh ohh
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No he won't come around here I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
Care about me I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
  i\'m sick of picking the pieces
and second-guessing
my reasons why you don\'t trust me
why must we do this to one another?
we are just passionate lovers
with trouble under the covers
nothing worse than when
you know that it\'s over
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead
please don\'t leave, stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
well i\'ve got nothing to hide
dip down and come for a ride
i\'m racing the devil, so sly
you cannot hear him coming
\'cause my defences are weak
i have no breath left to speak
so take my evidence
and bury it somewhere
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead
please don\'t leave, stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
oh my, i don\'t mind
being the other guy
nice try, for these games
i do not have the time
if you want me, call me
come and take a risk £¨kiss£©
leave somewhere deep under the surface
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead
please don\'t leave, stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it?
  I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath' after that
After that
Try to get you back

I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
£¨Yeah£©
So this is goodbye

Goddamn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you¡¯re going through
I get behind' make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference'
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you're feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye

I¡¯ve been here before
One day a week
And it won¡¯t hurt anymore

You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
And I...and so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference'
It even makes a difference to try

And you talk about how you're feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye

So this is goodbye' yeah £¨x 3£©

  Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I¡¯m not your type
But I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn
You¡¯re not the only one
I\'d let you be if you
put down your blazing gun
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
Sometimes you move so well
It¡¯s hard not to give in
I¡¯m lost, I can¡¯t tell
Where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn
You¡¯re with another man
I wonder if he¡¯s half
The lover that I am
Now you¡¯ve gone somewhere else Far away
I don¡¯t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath On your neck
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m right behind you (right behind you)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don¡¯t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
¡®Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don¡¯t mind
¡®Cause we got much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things
that make you who you are
I know that goodbye
means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to
catch her every time she falls
Yeah!
Tap on my window,
knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner
in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl
with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

%You guys are having fun with us tonight!%
%You know how happy you make us to see you guys now%
%It's always a cool thing to see you singing the words to our songs%
%But then we have a new record out and we work so hard on it%
%See you guys singing the words so early on, it's amazing thing, thank you guys%
%We are very happy you like the new music%
%Making you happy makes us happy%
%And if that many people in the room are happy, you'll have no idea what gonna happen%

(Music)
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
You come back
I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...

Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
You come back
And I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Feel~
Feel~
Feel~Yeah~

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you
Show you
Show you
Show you
Show you
Show you how I feel
Hoo~o~no
Yeah~

I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
Oh
The words that were mend
the things that were broken
But now its far too late she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking why does this happen to me
Why does every moment have to be so hard
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
And the noises that she make keep me awake
Oh
The weight of things that remain unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking why does this happen to me
Why does every moment have to be so hard
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
Should not ever let you go

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
ow dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This Double Vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin'  tread the ground that I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I asked her to stay but she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
Oh
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of your breath, I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake
oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
I won't go home without you (Oh Oh Oh Oh)
I won't go home without you (Huuuuu)
Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh
I won't go home without you(Hooooo)
Just give me one more chance to make it right
And I won't go home without you

So  this  is  Christmas
And  what  have  you  done
Another  year  over
And  a  new  one  just  begun
Ans  so  this  is  Christmas
I  hope  you  have  fun
The  near  and  the  dear  one
The  old  and  the  young
A  very  merry  Christmas
And  a  happy  New  Year
Let's  hope  it's  a  good  one
Without  any  fear
And  so  this  is  Christmas
For  weak  and  for  strong
For  rich  and  the  poor  ones
The  world  is  so  wrong
And  so  happy  Christmas
For  black  and  for  white
For  yellow  and  red  ones
Let's  stop  all  the  fight
A  very  merry  Christmas
And  a  happy  New  Year
Let's  hope  it's  a  good  one

War  is  over  over
If  you  want  it
War  is  over
Now

I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello!Hello!
Hello!Hello!
Hello!Hello!
Hello!Hello!Hello!

  This has not been easy
this has been hard
I am scarred
and I do not know what to do with you.
go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
grab your hips, cant remember why i fell in love with this.
but i miss you, i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time cause oh no
you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again cause oh no
i dont need you
Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face,
so dont go shooting up the place
make no mistake the loves not real
cause the love that i got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
i dont need you tonight
it was really nice to know you
but, theres nothing left to show you
i got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
and even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...
i miss you, i love you
you beg me you ask me
to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again
cause oh no, i dont need you
and i miss you, i love you
you beg me, you ask me to
cause oh no, I dont need you tonight

Oh yeah yeah...Cross a flower in you hair 
±ð¶ä»¨ÔÚÄãµÄ·¢ÉÒ
  I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said
Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for

Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
This not goodbye she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed
Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for

Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through

I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
(Yeah)
So this is goodbye
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you¡¯re going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
I¡¯ve been here before
One day a week
And it won¡¯t hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don\'t have a meaning
Cause
I still don¡¯t have the reason
And you don¡¯t have the time
And it really makes me wonder
And I...and so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don¡¯t believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you talk about how you\'re feeling
But I don¡¯t believe it¡¯s true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye, yeah
  Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away 
 You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway 
 It makes you burn to learn that you're not the only one 
 I'd let you be if you put down your blazin' gun 
 
 Now you've gone somewhere else, far away 
 I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you) 
 But you feel my breath on your neck 
 Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you) 
 
 Cause you keep me coming back for more 
 And I feel a little better than I did before 
 If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
 Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 
 
 Sometimes you move so well it's hard not to give in 
 I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin 
 It makes me burn to learn you're with another man 
 I wonder if he's half the lover that I am 
 
 Now you've gone somewhere else, far away 
 I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you) 
 But you feel my breath on your neck 
 Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you) 
 
 Cause you keep me coming back for more 
 And I feel a little better than I did before 
 If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
 Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 
 
 Baby, baby, please believe me 
 Find it in your heart to reach me 
 Promise not to leave me behind 
 (Promise not to leave me behind) 
 
 Take me down but take it easy 
 Make me think but don't decieve me 
 Torture me by taking your time 
 (Torture me, torture me) 
 
 Keep me coming back for more 
 And I feel a little better than I did before 
 If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
 Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 
 
 Keep me coming back for more 
 And I feel a little better than I did before 
 If I never see your face again, I don't mind 
 Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight 






  Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms
Open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I

Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Feel, babe
Feel
Feel
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show love, show love
Show love...
Show...
(guitar solo)
After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes its a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
The rhythm of the conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
Said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sunThe Sun

  

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin tread the ground I am walking on
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way  we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way  we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring and you wish you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way  we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
  When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone,
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone,
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? (find yourself alone)
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To see how I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone,
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone,
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone,
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
  I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I was so high
I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
It's all right, It's all right
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
maroon 5
through with you
can you see me
floating above your head
as you lay in bed
thinking about everything
that you did not do
cause saying i love you
has nothing to do with meaning it
...
and i don't trust you
cause every time you're here
your intentions are unclear
i spend every hour waiting for a phone call
that i know will never come
i used to think you were the one
now i'm sick of thinking anything at all
you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
do you remember
the way we used to melt
do you remember how it felt
when i touched you
oh cause i remember very well
oh oh
and how long has it been
since someone you let in
has given what i gave to you?
...
and at night when you sleep
do you dream i would be there
just for a minute or two do you?
you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know i'm through with you
...
you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know i'm through
i called to let you know i'm through
i called to let you know i'm through with you
i ain't never coming back to you
  I didn't hear what you were saying.
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me.
So who the hell are you to save me
I never would have made it babe.
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I¡¯m taking love
And it¡¯s not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What¡¯s coming now
So don¡¯t say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don¡¯t you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don\'t think so.
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I¡¯m taking love
And it¡¯s not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What¡¯s coming now
So don¡¯t say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don¡¯t you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don¡¯t feel so bad, I don¡¯t feel so bad, I don¡¯t feel so bad
I'm so sorry darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Woah oh ohh
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don¡¯t you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here anymore? I don¡¯t feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don¡¯t you care about me anymore?
Don¡¯t you care about me? I don¡¯t think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won¡¯t come around here anymore
No, he won¡¯t come around here. I don¡¯t feel so bad
I don¡¯t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don¡¯t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)


shiver
you build me up
you knock me down
provoke a smile
and make me frown
you are the queen of runaround
you know it's true
you chew me up
and spit me out
enjoy the taste
i leave in your mouth
you look at me
i look at you
neither of us know what to do
there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
i shiver when i hear your name
think about you but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied til i'm under your skin
immobilized by the thought of you
paralyzed by the sight of you
hypnotized by the words you say
not true but i believe em anyway
so come to bed it's getting late
there's no more time for us to waste
remember how my body tastes
you feel your heart begin to race
there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
i shiver when i hear your name
think about you but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'till i'm under your skin
there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
i shiver when i hear your name
think about you but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'till i'm under your skin

Living easy
Living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey momma
Look at me
I'm on my way the promised land
Don't stop me
Oh yeah come on
Oh yeah
So good
And I'm going down
All the way down
I'm on the highway to hell
Oh yeah



If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love is more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
that you would love me more than her

If I trust in you, oh please
don't run and hide,
if I love you too, oh please
don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
would love to love you
And that she will cry
when she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
would love to love you
And that she will cry
when she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

  Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her everytime she falls
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Sunday morning £¬rain is falling
Steal some covers £¬share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
£¨Someday£©
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh..yeah.But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
£¨life gets hard to do£©
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, Someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
May not know that may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow......
Cross a flower in your hair
Cross a flower in your hair
  I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me





Woah
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

That she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Loved... yeah...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Cause I won't say goodbye anymore





You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me complicate you
You let me penetrate you
Help me I broke apart my insides
Help me I¡¯ve got no soul to sell
Help me the only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself
I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god

You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
Help me tear down my reason
Help me its' your sex I can smell
Help me you make me perfect
Help me become somebody else
I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god






I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes

Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket for a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Takin' everything in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on a highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spinnin'
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan
Paid my dues
Playin' in a rocking band
Hey momma
Look at me
I'm on my way to the Promised Land, wooh
I'm on a highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell

And I'm going down, wooh





My Blue Ocean - Maroon 5
I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story

About this lovely girl who's name was Jane

She was vast and deep and filled with glory

Ah ah ah

Bottom served as home for hull and anchor

She's always fit to quarrel with the wind

The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her

Ah ah ah

Then she heard me
Say that oath that
Made everything clear

I love you

My ocean blue

I like the way your sea sees me

My darling Jane

She speaks to me at times through falling rain

Now was time to manifest her vigor

Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?

The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger

Ah ah ah

Then she heard me
Say that oath that
Made everything clear

I love you

My ocean blue

I like the way your sea sees me

My darling Jane

Oh me, my darling Jane

Oh me and my darling Jane

She speaks to me at times through falling rain

Speaks to me at times through falling rain

Every day, people sway
Softly lulling me to sleep
I look the other way
But I still can't look too deep
I think I'll fall asleep
I think I'll fall asleep

So call up and tell him that you will survive
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
You and me and everything's gonna be fine

Every night, people fight
Gently lulling me to sleep
What gives me the right
To waste away and weep
I think I'll turn away
There's nothing left to say

So call up and tell him that you will survive
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
You and me and everything's gonna be fine

So you wanna have everything your heart desires
There's  a fistful of people with their hearts on fire
Make your way on up to the front of the line

Get out of my way
I'm here now to stay
Get out of my way
I'm here now to stay

So call up and tell him that you will survive
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
You and me and everything's gonna be fine
So you wanna have everything your heart desires
There's a fistful of people with their hearts on fire
Make your way on up to the front of the line


The Fog - Maroon 5

Here in this town they have all got the blues

As the paper boy takes off without any news

Angels have wings you can feel free to use

The corner store drugs you can freely abuse
And I'm yelling and screaming
Cause baby you're driving me crazy

So life on your own has been vacant and cold
Everyones getting somewhere
And you're getting old

Career opportunities
They all have been sold

Along with your body and most of your soul

And I'm yelling and screaming
Cause baby you're driving me crazy

If I could spare more remorse
From my emptied out pores I would maybe

Cause the fogs getting thicker
The worlds spinning fast

The chaos is building
It's going too last

And it's so hard to see
And you're so hard to find

The days when I think
I am losing my mind

So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes

Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens

When you start frowning
They think you're obscene

As you work overtime to make sure they can dream

I'm yelling and screaming
Cause baby you're driving me crazy

If I could spare more remorse
From my emptied out pores I would maybe

Cause the fogs getting thicker
The worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building  it's going too last
And it's so hard to see
And you're so hard to find

The days when I think I am losing my mind

And we yell and we scream
As the fogs getting thicker
The worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building  it's going to last

And it's so hard to see
And you're so hard to find

The days when I think
I am losing my mind

And the fogs getting thicker
The worlds spinning fast
The chaos is building  it's going to last

And it's so hard to see
And you're so hard to find

The days when I think I am losing my mind





How you're feeling
When the day has had its way
With the both of us
No, I've gone out of my way but I'm not free
From this pain I'm breathing
I was a fool to think
Someday you would come around
No, no, no, I'm not thinking that way
Cause now I see you are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream
I think you should just go away cause
There's no necessity for you to stay
And next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not coming in

How's your day been yeah
Cause mine has taken
Strange and ugly turns
But no, no, no, I feel better today
Cause I'm on my knees
You are not what you seem, you are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream, yeah
I think you should just go away cause
There's no necessity for you to stay
And next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not coming in
A heart lived for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows lock my doors
Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more, yeah

I think you should just go away cause
There's no necessity for you to stay
And next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not coming in
A heart lived for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows lock my doors
Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more
Ooh...
Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more





can you see me
floating above your head
as you lay in bed
thinking about everything
that you did not do
cause saying i love you
has nothing to do with meaning it
and i don't trust you
cause every time you're here
your intentions are unclear
that i know will never come
i used to think you were the one
now i'm sick of thinking anything at all
you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that

do you remember
the way we used to melt
do you remember how it felt

when i touched you
oh cause i remember very well


oh oh
and how long has it been
since someone you let in
has given what i gave to you

and at night when you sleep

do you dream i would be there
just for a minute or two do you

you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be

you take my hand just to give it back

no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much

a simple love with a complex touch

there is nothing you can say or do

i called to let you know i'm through with you







you ain't ever coming back to me
that's not how things were supposed to be

you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
there is nothing you can say or do

i called to let you know i'm through

i called to let you know i'm through
i called to let you know i'm through with you

i ain't never coming back to you

I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
I have tried
So very hard as hell
To stay away from hell
And live upstairs
But when I see
All of your remedies
I try quite desperately
To go home
I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
I've been acting irresponsibly
But what could possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?
But if I sit here lonely
With no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself
I'm trying to control
Myself

Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines
in her smile
Something Is not right
Where are you hiding
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and
Feel the never need to
Go back to theway I was
The way I was
I tried and tried
and tried and tried
But I have no
concept of consequence
And I'm a master
of self defence
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to
Where are you hiding
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I
Feel the never need to
Go back to the
way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I
Feel the never need to
Go back to the
way I was
The way I was
I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far
I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I
Feel the never need to
Go back to the
way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I
Feel the never need to
Go back to the
way I was
The way I was





  And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
  Wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
Way it felt to hearing lies
Pleasure that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath,after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have reason
And you don't have time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
£¨Yeah£©
So this is goodbye
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
Want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind,make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning
Cause
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a think about you and I
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you tell me how you feelin
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
£¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye £¨Oh no£©
So this is goodbye £¨Oh no£©
yeah
So this is goodbye





I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you' discuss whats going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?

Tell me so that i understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughs
To make up for the love i just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
I woke up this mornign with the hurting that i would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy

Who is she' what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?
Tell me so that i understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughs
To make up for the love i just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway





Forty Five - Maroon 5
If you lost your mind tonight

And theres no one left to save you

Keep this song inside your pocket

Your pocket's good enough to stop it

And if you lost the fight its alright

because theres no one here to blame you

Leave your turn table on
Forty-five is good

I'm Forty-five, Forty-five keeps me alive!

If you lost your shirt tonight

and theres no one to come save you

Keep the bullet in your pocket

cause cellphones always stop it

If you hate yourself its alright

because there's no one here to see you

Leave your turn table on
Forty-five is good

I'm forty-five, forty-five keeps me alive!

If you lost the fight its alright

because theres no one here to blame you

Keep your turn table on Forty-five is good

I'm Forty-five, Forty-five keeps me alive!
.

Danced all night, slept all day
Kill us with my heart again
Feelings when it comes to playing games
You don't cry, and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
Take what you want
And I will be just fine
You'll be better off alone at night
Waiting, falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?




Woman
Singer:Maroon 5

Woman
If i'd be so inclined to climb up beside you,
would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well,
will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Yeah,yeah,oh,woah,woah,woah,woah,woah,wa. Oh no.
If l could bottle up the chills that you gave me,
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman,
It is you that would come flowing from my pen, yeah.
Leaving your clothes on my floor,
making me walk out the door and,
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Oooo,oo,oo oo,oo,oo,oo,oh,woah,oo,oh,oo,woah.
Fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Aey,ee,aey,aey,mmm
Music
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun,
As she burns me,I am screaming loud for more.
I drink every drop of liquid heat that i've become.
Pop me open spill me out onto the floor.
Leaving your smell on my coat,
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand.
Leaving your smell on my coat,
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
Yeah,woo,yeah,woooo
Yeeeeeaaaa,woooooo
Baby,baby,yeah
The end

Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar,
That only I have seen.

Do you give just to please yourelf?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried,
said that it was all for me.

And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true,
It comes true.

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I\'ve said?
Took the dive just to feel alive,
but never heard the truth.

Now I\'m in love but I don\'t know how
I\'m in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close,
I slowly open mine.

And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true.

I am so confused by this.
I know that life is hit or miss.
Days are stung by too much sun,
I think that you may be the one.

Cover yourself up in me,
Shrouded in what could have been.
I will listen to your pain,
if you listen to me.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes True,
Come true,
True,
It comes true,
True.

...
...
...THE END ...
  Just you shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And in for my heart
If you feel like
Can take me away
And make it okay
I swear i'll behave
You wanted control
Sure we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say i'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And i'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And i'll show you
Want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and i'll own you
With the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger
Baby it's hard
And it feel like you're broken in scar
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That i've got the key
So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to stir
But i'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And i'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And i'll show you
Want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and i'll own you
With the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger
You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And i'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And i'll show you
Want the moves like jagger

I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and i'll own you
With the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagge
What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified

What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything? I need to survive
'Cause at 4am, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life? £¨Oh£©

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway

What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
It's my twisted way of keeping you close yeah yeah
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? did it send?
Or do get along on your own? oh

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway

And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway ohh oh

I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
And I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway

Runaway, runaway
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway

Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway


Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt

Clothes on the bed, so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door

On our way home I realise

There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes

Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

Cos we're out of goodbyes

We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same about me

I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man
On our way home I realise

There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes

Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time

I need to move on and I need you to try

Cos we're out of goodbyes

We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes
  I watched u cry bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
U said u wished u did not love me anymore
U left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine' no sunshine
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even done
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
Cuz I can't believe that it's over
U've hit your low
U've lost control' u won't come back
U may not believe me but I gave u all I had
Oh just confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears I
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine' no sunshine
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even done
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have

No I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

So much to say it's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems and stare right thru my eyes

And in that darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
It's just a feeling just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling just a feeling that I have

No I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
No I can't believe that it's over No I can't believe that it's over





There's something about my ego tell her back up Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes I just sex 'em bend the ass like Beckham
Undress 'em respect 'em just for the night
Then after that I forget them
Neglected I'm sorry girl turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played Atari
No time for tears if you cryin' call Maury
Got girls by the army feelin' kinda horny
Love it when I'm on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap but I spend big
Cause I
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like it
And take me away
I'll make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now we're naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
Baby it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key
So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I'm a rich bastard Mic Jagger
Say I got them moves
I was a Rolling Stone girls call my phone
Let it ring I'm way too cool
Get a little bit of dome when I'm in arenas
Messin' with these ho's that be so eager
But no need to tease her
I'ma go on with Christina
So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe ooh baby roll me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the mooooooves like Jagger

Woke up swinging from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my own life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you
All my hidden desires finally came alive
No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my own life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
Woke up swinging from a tree
With a different kind of feeling
It was always you
Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
It was always you
  You and I go hard, at each other like we going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get sore, then dysfunctional we stuck keeping score
You and I get sick, they all know that we can't do this no more
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
that i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Trying to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Trying to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'd be waking up, in the morning probably hating myself
And i'd be waking up, feeling sastified but guilty as hell
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,

  I know your inside, you're feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
But I fall for you, i'll never recover
If I fall for you, i'll never be the same
I really want to love somebody
I really want to dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way,

I really want to touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there

  How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin tread the ground I am walking on
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cr ies in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring and you wish you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone
I'm at a payphone





I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah I
I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights

Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song
I'll be sick
Oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow

While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw

Phantom pull up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

Down on my knees

  I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of sh*t
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...
Wiz Khalifa
Man work that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with the push up a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now ask me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Now I'm at a Payphone

Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
and I thought I saw you out there crying
and I thought I heard you call my name
and I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same
God,give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Whoo!)
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

Unkiss Me - Maroon 5
If you respect me
Don't protect me

You can tell me,

I can handle it

Stop pretending,

cause we're going down

If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful
how you've handled this

Never ending,
kinda round around

I lie to my heart
cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire,
if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me

If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing

But if you're gonna
Well, when you're better off
Unkiss me, untouch me

Untake this heart

And I miss this

Just one thing

A brand new star

Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it, that you're over us

If I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter,
what's the point of this?
We're in pieces,

because you're over us

I lie to my heart
cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire,
if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me

If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing

But if you're gonna
Well, when you're better off
Unkiss me, untouch me

Untake this heart

And I miss this

Just one thing

A brand new star

Unkiss me

Unkiss me

So baby let go

Gotta let go
It's disrespectful
I can't handle it

Never ending,
kinda round around

Unkiss me, untouch me

Untake this heart

oh no no no

And I miss this

Just one thing

A brand new star

So unkiss me

So unkiss me

Unkiss me


Woke up swinging from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my own life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more saying who
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you
All my hidden desires finally came alive
No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my own life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
Woke up swinging from a tree
With a different kind of feeling
It was always you
Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
It was always you

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I¡¯m searching for a song tonight
I¡¯m changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can¡¯t get over you
No I just can¡¯t get over you
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest times
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights
Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
and I thought I saw you out there crying
and I thought I heard you call my name
and I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same
God,give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And not matter the cost

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming

Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer

Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh

Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star

Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats

You got in so late
It's sunday morning
Said that you were leaving

Letting go of us

Where did we go wrong? oh

And now you say
you're leaving California
Gotta head back East

want to leave tonight

Pack your things and go

But if you run now
Wait I won't be alright
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go

Woke up swinging from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my own life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more saying who
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you
All my hidden desires finally came alive
No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind

But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
Woke up swinging from a tree
With a different kind of feeling
It was always you
Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I¡¯m searching for a song tonight
I¡¯m changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can¡¯t get over you
No I just can¡¯t get over you
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest times
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Chose your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes
And let them go,let them fly
Holding back,won't turn back time

Your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first I met you,so in love that night

  She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
And you had to wait for in it, when your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a bu-bu-bu snob that you'll never know the truth
The perfect on me answer, but nothing at the call
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart, your perfect little body makes me fall apart
She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation got me lost
So I will do my best to get you all
The perfect on me answer, but nothing at the call
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart, your perfect little body makes me fall apart
She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
La la la la la la la laaaaaa
Yeah...
She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow

And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow

Splendidyang

Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder
Oh, but i'm scared to tell
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
I'm so sad, saaad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one
Oh, but i'm scared to tell
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
I'm so sad, saaad

I'm so sad, so sad

Oh, but i'm scared to tell
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad

  I'm not a fortune teller
I won't be bringing news of what tomorrow brings
I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller
Don't have crystal ball
I can't predict the future
Can't see nothing at all
It doesn't mean i'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back
No matter how hard I try
Some of it will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you have to do it again
Why you have to go, and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's miss

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
I never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller

I don't like watching TV
I don't know what that all means
And your american dream, baby it just stays in me
I know what i'm thinking, may not be in your mind
I know the song i'm singing, it's not your favorite kind
It doesn't mean i'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back
No matter how hard I try
Some of it will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you have to do it again
Why you have to go, and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's miss

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
I never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller

This feeling, keeps growing, these rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers when you drive me in questions

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
I never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
I never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller

Baby it's not alright
The second that you turn your back she'll me outta sight
Baby she'll break your heart, the second that you spend the night apart
How could you do it? oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made
How could you do it?, oh you better watch yourself
I think that girl's insane

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller


Baby she'll eat alive, as soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive, before she makes you her latest slaughter
How could you do it? oh, just come back to me, baby i'm begging please
How could you do it?, oh she knows I love you still, you're just a ladies killer

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller


Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's a like cheap thriller

Ooooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

  I know your inside, you're feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
But if I fall for you, i'll never recover
If I fall for you, i'll never be the same

  In the middle of hollywood boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like oh oh oh, can't take it anymore oh oh oh
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other, like oh oh oh
It isn't funny anymore, oh oh

But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh

Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, go go, you never need to know, oh oh
I don't wanna be picking up all of these tiny litle pieces, tiny litle pieces
Of your heart, oh oh, won't do it anymore, oh oh

But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh

  You're such a motivator, I gotta get you where
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike
Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
Stuck in an elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said i'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She make me want her right now right now
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike
Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million
  Here I am waiting, i'll have to leave soon
Why am i, holding on?
We knew this would come, we knew it all along
How did it, come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And i'm trying not to sleep
Cause I know, when I wake, I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
Here I am staring at your perfection
 In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard, cause I know
When the sun comes out, I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
I never wanted to stop because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark but now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah)
Oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah!
  I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now i'm paralyzed
Still stucked in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know i've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now i'm paralyzed
Still stucked in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Now i'm at a payphone...
Now fuck that shit
I'll be right here spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came out from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me i'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it i'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled out valet open doors
Wiz like go way, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song i'll be sick
Now i'm at a payphone
  You and I go hard,
at each other like we going to war
You and I go rough,
we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get sore,
then dysfunctional we stuck keeping score
You and I get sick,
they all know that we can't do this no more
But baby there you again,
there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head,
using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body,
on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid,
feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
that i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Trying to tell you no,
but my body keeps on telling you yes
Trying to tell you stop,
but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'd be waking up,
in the morning probably hating myself
And i'd be waking up,
feeling sastified but guilty as hell
But baby there you again,
there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head,
using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body,
on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid,
feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
that i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
But baby there you again,
there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head,
using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body,
on my body like a tattoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I cross my heart,
and I hope to die,
that i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
(yeah baby give me one more night)
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
that i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I¡¯m searching for a song tonight
I¡¯m changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can¡¯t get over you
No I just can¡¯t get over you
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest times
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights
Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I¡¯m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

  After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I can not remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life
gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I can not forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her
take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I can not forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
The rhythm of the conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt
when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
But I can not forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
But I can not forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
yeah
ooh
several miles from the sun

  If i'd be so inclined
to climb up beside you
would you tell me
that the time just isn't right
And if I ever find
the key you hide so well
will you tell me
that I can spend the night
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
what it is about this woman
If l could bottle up the chills
that you gave me
I would keep them in a jar
next to my bed
And if I should ever draw
a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing
from my pen yeah
Leaving your clothes on my floor
making me walk out the door and
I still fail to understand
what it is about this woman
Helplessly melting as
I stand next to the sun
As she burns me
I am screaming loud for more
I drink every drop of liquid heat
that i've become
Pop me open spill me out onto the floor
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand

But I get so high when I'm inside you
Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea

Taking me down rolling on the ground

  How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way
With both of us
And no,

But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think some day
You would come around
But no no no
I'm not thinking that way
'cause now I see
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes
I just wanna scream
I think you should
Just go away cause
There's no necessity
For you to stay and
Next time
You come around my way
Forget it baby your not comin' in
How's your day been?
'cause mine
Has taken strange
And ugly turns
But no no no
I feel better today

Sometimes
I just wanna scream
I think you should
Just go away cause
There's no necessity
For you to stay and
Next time you
Come around my way
Forget it baby

A heart made for
A lot of sorrow
No you can't
Come back tomorrow
Shut my windows,
Lock my doors

Won't be your rag doll anymore
Yeah

Just go away cause
There's no necessity
For you to stay and
Next time you
Come around my way

Come back tomorrow
Shut my windows,
Lock my doors
'cause my heart won't be
Your rag doll anymore
Who

  I woke up this morning
with the burden of love
hanging over my head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you, discuss what's going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
oh
Tell me so that I understand
I just need some time
Gather all my thought
To make up for the love
I just lost
You've been so good to me,
given me everything
Take what you want
'cause it doesn't belong to me
I woke up this morning
with the hurting
that I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she?
what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
oh
Tell me so that I understand
oh
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
given me everything
Take what you want
'cause it doesn't belong to me anyway
oh...
eh...
oh...
yeah...
oh...
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love
I just lost
You've been so good to me
given me everything
Take what you want
'cause it doesn't belong to me
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love
I just lost
You've been good to me
given me everything
Take what you want
'cause it doesn't belong to me








  Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends
then when do we start
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
oh
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
hey uh uh
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever ever ever did receive
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here
that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here
that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
feel feel feel
  When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown find I have grown
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To see how i have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home








  Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no they can't
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
oh  Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say i'm not there yet
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no they can't








  Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers
share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us
in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the
mold that I am in
But things just get
so crazy living life
gets hard to do
And I would gladly
hit the road get up
and go if I knew
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness she is
all I see
Come and rest your
bones with me
Driving slow on
Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway
like branches in a storm
Change the weather still
together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness she is
all I see
Come and rest your
bones with me
Driving slow on
Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
May not know that
may be all I need
In darkness she
is all I see
Come and rest your
bones with me
Driving slow
Driving slow
yeah...
Cross a flower
in your hair
Cross a flower
in your hair








  I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights
and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Stange my hands and feels
to the corner of your bed
Fumbling through your dresser
door forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy
and we must get out
This not goodbye she said
It is just time for me
to rest my head
She does not walk she runs instead
Down these jagged streets
and into my bed
Fumbling through your dresser
door forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy
and we must get out








  After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt
to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life
gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't
how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her take a breath
Feel the beat
in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't

She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
from the sun
The rhythm of the conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt
when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't

She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles

year...
oh...
several miles from the sun








  I'm full of regret
For all the things
That have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be OK to show
My face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever
Turn your head and look
See if I'm gone
I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
I don't know
How I got so tangled up
You're just an innocent
A helpless victim of a spiders web
And I'm an insect
Going after anything that I can get
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know
How I got so tangled up
 There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know
How I got so tangled up

  Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some troblue with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved








  You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run around
You know it's true
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better
find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you but
it's not the same
I won't be satisfied
'til I'm under your skin
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe em anyway
So come to bed It's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better
find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you but
it's not the same
I won't be satisfied
'till I'm under your skin
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better
find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you but
it's not the same
I won't be satisfied
'till I'm under your skin








  I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart,
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking
In front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, oh, oh.
Whoa, oh, oh.
Whoa, oh, oh.
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied,
Kept playing love like it was
Just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But oh, ohh.
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye
Too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking
In front of me
And she said goodbye
Too many times before








  How dare you say
That my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step
'Cause If I do you'll need a miracle
When it gets cold outside
And you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
like a little girl cries
In the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe
Then you drain me
make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision
I was seeing is finally clear
You try to stay but you know
Very well you want you gone
Not to funkin' tread the ground
I'm walking on
When it gets cold outside
And you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries
In the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe
When it gets cold outside
And you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean
When I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries
In the face of a monster
That lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there
'Cause it's getting harder
And harder to breathe








  Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no they can't
Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say "i'm not there yet!"
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh, no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh, no they can't








  Yeah..
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us
in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit
the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy
living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the
road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway
like branches in a storm
Change the weather still
together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh..yeah..but things just get so
crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling
and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll
bring me back to you..yeah..
Find a way to bring
myself back home to you
May not know that may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow... yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Cross a flower in your hair
Cross a flower in your hair
Yeah yeah,yeah yeah,
Oh,ohooo,yeah.......
.........yeah.......yeah......








  When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again my friend
Go on misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door' pick up the phone'
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone  yourself alone)
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
Does it make you mad
To see how I have grown
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door' pick up the phone'
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door' pick up the phone'
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door' pick up the phone'
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home








  Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends then
when do we start
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that
only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever ever ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that
only you and I could go
So I can show you
how I feel feel feel feel
How does it feel to know
you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that
only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
show you how feel
show you how feel
show I show you show
show you how I feel
  Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it
And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how this was supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how this was supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how this was supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you
I ain't never coming back to you








  After school walkin home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from the past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I
Cannot forget refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
With all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
And I'm movin on down my street
I see people I wont ever meet
I think of her take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes its a sad song ohh
But I
Cannot forget refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
With all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Rhythm of the conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
They way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
I cannot forget refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away l
Make everyday
With all of the pain
that I've gone through
And mama I've been cryin
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battles almost won
And we're only several miles
Said the battles almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
yeah oh








  I'm full of regret
For all the things
that I've done and said
And I don't know
if it'll ever be ok to show
My face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever turn your head and look
See if I'm gone
Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
oh~
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
oh~
You better turn your head and look
See if I'm gone
Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say
To you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
aw~
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
oh~
tangled up
oh~

And her heart is
Breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love
Like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is
Breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on her hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's
What you want me to do
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is
Breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause
I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is
Breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
This love has taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
And her heart is
Breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye
Too many times before
  Get Back in My Life
Maroon 5

You are relentless, I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?

You keep me senseless, I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I'll fall into the darkness,
it's impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

Beauty from many, you're so demanding
But I've got time, I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect, completely worthy
You got my back against my wall

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I fall into the darkness,
impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free (yeah)
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Running back to you, running back to you
Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life,
come knock

I'll never leave you alone

  I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known

And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone

I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying

Took you for granted
When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice

You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now

Don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man-be-a-woman now

I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up

Took you for granted
When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice

You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

But how?
But how?

Why must we be so ugly
And please do not stick up on me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to die

Why?
Why?
Why?

I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying

I do not mind if I die trying

I do not mind if I die trying

  Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me £¨put your hands all over me£©
I can't seem to find
The pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay
And she got up and ran away
Well now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything
It's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
£¨Put your hands all over me£©
Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything
It's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game you say

So come down off your cloud
Say it now
Say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl
Come make my day
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me

Now walk with me, walk with me now

Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me
  I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on

And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day

My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road

I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I never did my best to
Express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else

My, my world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking on the wrong side of the road

I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one

I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah...

  

You push me,
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down, take me down

You hurt me,
But do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down

So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So you say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it
I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud
Can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake
But you can't forget

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

You say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

  Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control

Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone

Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over, oh no

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone

I'm putting myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why she will not talk to me

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all

So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

  Ohh I really need to know
Ohh I really need to know
Ohh I really need to know
Ohh Ya gotta let me go
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night
Shudder
I can't believe it, I'm not myself, suddenly I'm thinkin' of no one else
You make me shudder
Ohh I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go
Your just a fantasy girl
In seven parts of the world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Give some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
You feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now ya got me screaming and I cannot shut up, shut up
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor barely even speaking
and I cannot get up, get up
Ohh I really, I really, I really need to know
Ya gotta let me go
Your just a fantasy girl
In seven parts of the world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Give some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
Give me affection

I need your perfection
You feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shaking me up
I cant eat, cant sleep, can't think, .....
Your just a fantasy girl
In seven parts of the world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Give some attention to me
All I want is you and me always

All I want is to be with you always

Till you come home babe' Till you come home
You taste past the poison' you learn to love has gone
I'm all alone baby' I'm all alone

Completely intertwined

  People never change,
They seem to stay the same.
They wear different clothes,
But play the same games.
Many different ways
To say the same thing.
Searchin for the right words,
The ones that would make you stay.
Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be,
Yeah.
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her,
The things that she never heard
But always deserved.
I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.
Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess,
And who threw what punch,
But I could not care less.
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, Ohhh.
Once I put this wasted pride aside,
Nothin's all I got, Ohhh.
Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be,
Yeah.
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her,
The things that she never heard
But always deserved.

The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.
Ohh,
Somebody make it stop.
Yeahh.
And pick me up,
And just dust me off, Ohh.
The rainy day flood,
Will drowned all this love.
Trapped at the bottom now,
Please dig me up.
I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,

  This thing called love,
I just can't handle it.
This thing called love,
I must get round to it.
I ain't ready,
crazy little thing called love !

This thing (this thing)
called love (called love).
It cries (like a baby),
in a cradle all night.
It swings (woooh woooh),
it jives (woooh woooh).
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kind of like it.
Crazy little thing called love !
There goes my baby,
she knows how to Rock'n'Roll.
She drives my crazy,
she gives me hot and cold fever.
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat.

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip !
Get on my track's,take a back seat.
Hitch hike,
and take a long ride on my motor bike.
Until I'm ready,
crazy little thing called love.

I gotta be cool relax get hip !
Get on my track's,take a back seat.
Hitch hike,
and take a long ride on my motor bike.
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie).
Crazy little thing called love !

I just can't handle it.

  yeahh...
oh...

some people live for the fortune
some people live just for the fame
some people live for the power yeah
some people live just to play the game
some people think that the physical things
define what's within
i've been there before
but that life's a bore
so full of the superficial

some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you

some people search for a fountain
promises forever young
some people need three dozen roses
and that's the only way to prove you love them
and in a world on a silver platter
and wondering what it means
no one to share, no one who truly cares for me

some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you

some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you baby
if i ain't got you baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you

if i ain't got you with me baby
nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
if i ain't got you with me baby

  So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
I'm the way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
I'm not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting here
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back


  1,2
1,2,3
You push me,
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down, take me down
You hurt me,
But do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So you say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it
I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud
Can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake
But you can't forget
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

  You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only tryin' to help

As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

5,4,3,2,1
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We've been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all

I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

5,4,3,2,1
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We've been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossin and turnin, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep,you're in too deep

5,4,3,2,1
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We've been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all
5,4,3,2,1
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call,
I will not fall
This may be the one
We've been waiting for
No curtain call,
Just take it all


  I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Half flesh that you yearn that grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

So oh, what you gonna do.
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh

Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more

So oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh

You don't make it easy to bring myself a safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you had
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
cause it's the only place you'll see my face

So oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
won't you wanna dance
This might be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
To love you, oh oh oh


  Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt

Clothes on the bed, so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door

On our way home I realise
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cos we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same about me

I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man

On our way home I realise
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cos we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes


  What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified
What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything? I need to survive
'Cause at 4am, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life? £¨Oh£©
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway
What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
It's my twisted way of keeping you close yeah yeah
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? did it send?
Or do get along on your own? oh
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway ohh oh
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
And I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway
Oh yeah

So scared of breaking it

And exactly what I need
Don ¡¯t need anybody but my ba-by
So where did all your love go
You play me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away
And I know that we can make it
And I know that you can feel it
So stop fooling around and just stay
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody see?
Seems like everything ¡¯s gone crazy
You ¡¯re exactly what I wanted
Exactly what I need
I don ¡¯t need nobody but my ba-by
It ¡¯s taken such a long time
To find what I ¡¯ve been looking for
And now that you are all mine
I've never felt quite like this before
Still want more
All you need in my mind
Because if so,then you already know
You ¡¯re all that I want and you ¡¯re all that I needed
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody see?
Seems like everything ¡¯s gone crazy
You ¡¯re exactly what I wanted
And exactly what I need
Don ¡¯t need anybody but my baby
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody see?
Seems like everything ¡¯s gone crazy
You ¡¯re exactly what I wanted
And exactly what I need
Don ¡¯t need noybody but my baby

i watched you cry
bathe in sunlingt by the bathroom door
you said you wish you did not love me anymore
you left your flowers in the backseat of my car
the things we said may have left permanent scars
obsessed,depressed at the same time
i can't even walk in a straight line
i'm a light in the dark,no sunshine
no sunshine,no sunshine
she cries,this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
you're not even there
it's just a feeling,just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
cause it's just a feeling,just a feeling,just a feeling
(i can't believe that it's over now)
you've hit your low
you've lost control, you want him back
you may not believe me but i gave you all i had
undressed,confessed that you're still mine
i rolled around in a bed full of tears and i
i'm still laying in the dark, no sunshine
no sunshine,no sunshine
she cries,this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
you're not even there
it's just a feeling,just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
just a feeling, just a feeling that i have
(no,i can't believe that it's over now)
it's just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
so much to say it's not the way she does her hair
it's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
and in that darkest day that she refused to run away
from love she tried so hard to save
it's just a feeling,just a feeling, just a feeling that i have
just a feeling, just a feeling that i have
it's just a feeling
it's just a feeling,just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
it's just a feeling,just a feeling,just a feeling that i have
(i can't believe that it's over)
just a feeling, just a feeling that i have
(i can't believe that it's over)
and i can't believe that it's over.yeah


  You are relentless, I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?

You keep me senseless, I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I'll fall into the darkness,
it's impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

Beauty from many, you're so demanding
But I've got time, I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect, completely worthy
You got my back against my wall

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I fall into the darkness,
impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free (yeah)
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Running back to you, running back to you
Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life,
come knock

I'll never leave you alone


I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another?
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Well I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
I'm racing the devil, so sly
You cannot hear him coming
'Cause my defences are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take my evidence
And bury it somewhere
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Oh my, I don't mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk (kiss)
Leave somewhere deep under the surface
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
I'm the way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
I'm not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad

So far away from you
I'm getting here

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
I can't seem to find
The pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay
And she got up and ran away
Well now, I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
All over me
So come down off your cloud
Say it now, say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make my day
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
All over me
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me

Oh yeah¡­¡­

oh...
I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
'til I'm broken down and all alone
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
Took it for granted when you lifted me up
I'm asking for your help,
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how
But how
I can feel it in my bones what's going on with him now
Don't patronise me with lies, I'm a man, be a woman now
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up
Took it for granted when you lifted me up
I'm asking for your help,
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how
But how
But how
But how
Why must we be so ugly
Please do not think ill of me
Why does the one you love become the one who makes you want to
Cry
Why
Why
Why
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying...
I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down
The wrong side of the road
I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat
For me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat
Like yesterday
I never did my best to
Express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking on the
Wrong side of the road, oh yeah
I can't lie on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat
For me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat
Like yesterday
My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things
I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one
I can't lie on my mind
Story inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat
For me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat
Like yesterday
I can't lie on my mind
Story inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat
For me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat
Like yesterday
I can't lie on my mind
Story inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat
For me instead, yeah


  You push me
I don't have the strength toResist or control you
So take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So you say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it
I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud
Can you hear me yet
Try to stay awake
But you can't forget
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't worth it
And I say no
It isn't perfect
So I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Living inside my head, pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all of my heart was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone
Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone, go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over, oh no
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone, alone now
Alone, I don't wanna be
I'm putting myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason
Why she will not talk to me
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone, alone now
Alone, I don't wanna be
I'm tired proving you right
Doing everything so wrong
Don't wanna be
Don't know nothing
I don't know nothing 'bout that
I don't know nothing at all

I really, I really
Whoa
I really need to know
I really, I really
Whoa
Or else, ya gotta let me go, oh
I really, I really
This time I really need to do things right
The shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinkin' about no one else
You make me shudder
I really, I really need to know
Or else ya gotta let me go
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
You feel so good you make me stutter, stutter
If I could touch you I would never let go
Now you got me screaming and I can not shut up
Oh, now I'm lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I can not get up
I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else ya gotta let me go, oh
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
You feel so good you make me stutter
I really, stutter, I really, stutter, stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shakin' me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think, sinking under
I'm sinkin' under
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Coz, you feel so good you make me stutter
I really, I really, you make me stutter.

Now you've been bad and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home
You taste best, the poison I've learned to love has gone,
I'm all alone baby I'm all alone
I'm waiting for somethin' always waiting feeling nothing,
wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more oooh babe ohoh,
give a little more oooh babe ohoh
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm fallin' in love
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby,
ohoh get a little more from you baby
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on and on and on
You make it so hard
I'm waiting for somethin' always waiting,
feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more oooh babe ohoh,
give a little more oooh babe ohoh
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm fallin' in love
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby,
ohoh get a little more from you baby
If I have no defense I know you're gonna get me in the end
And I can not pretend I ever wanna feel this way again
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm fallin' in love
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby,
ohoh get a little more from you baby
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm fallin' in love
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby,
ohoh get a little more from you baby.

So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be and I'll set you free oh yeah
I am in misery there ain't nobody who can comfort me oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me oh yeah
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel its what I didn't show
So let me be and I'll set you free
I am in misery there ain't no line that could comfort me oh yeah
Why won't you answer me the silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
You say your faith is shakin' you may be mistaken
Keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to run
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me answer me yeah
I am in misery there ain't no line that could comfort me oh yeah
Why won't you answer me, your silence is slowing killing me, oh yeah
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad.


Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say, "I'm not there yet"
Oh but can they keep it
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
she will be loved
She will be loved
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved

I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything is reminding me of you
What can I do?
It's not right, not OK
Say the word it should say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
It's better that we break¡­
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
I see you look so nice from here
Pity I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there, it disappears
It disappears
It's better that we break up
Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold,
but that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
It knocks you down and beats you up
But it's just a rollercoaster anyway, yeh
I'm not fine, not OK
Harder everyday
It's better that we break up,baby
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
I'm the way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
I'm not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting here
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind

Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before

And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied

Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright

My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips

every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me

She said Goodbye too many times before

And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said Goodbye too many times before
  I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember

The people we used to be

It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me.
You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If "Happy Ever After" did exist,

I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday.

I gave you my love to borrow,
But you just gave it away.
You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down.
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If "Happy Ever After" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.

Now I'm at a payphone
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning,
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it,
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it,
Don't need my name on my shirt,
You can tell it I'm ballin.
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for.
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If "Happy Ever After" did exist,

I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.

Now I'm at a payphone

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her everytime she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

I tried so hard to say good-bye






  

You shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And in for my heart
If you feel like
Can take me away, and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
Sure we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a sh*t
And it goes like this
Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And I'll show you
You want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger
I don't even try to control you

Look into my eyes and I'll own you
You with the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger
Verse 2]
Baby it's hard
And it feel like you're broken in scar
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key

So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to stir
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here

And it goes like this
Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And I'll show you
You want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger

I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
You with the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger
You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this
Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss til you're drunk
And I'll show you
You want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger

I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
You with the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves...like jagger







You and I go hard, at each other like we going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get sore, then dysfunctional we stuck keeping score
You and I get sick, they all know that we can't do this no more
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
That i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Trying to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Trying to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'd be waking up, in the morning probably hating myself
And i'd be waking up, feeling sastified but guilty as hell
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
That i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
That i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
That i'll only stay with you one more night
And I know i've said it a million times
But i'll only stay with you one more night

I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason

And you don't have the time

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference to try

Yeah
So this is goodbye

Goddamn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason

And you don't have the time

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore

You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause I still don't have the reason

And you don't have the time

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
And I and so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
Yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore

I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So this is goodbye

Oh no
So this is goodbye, oh no yeah
So this is goodbye, oh no yeah
So this is goodbye

I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees

And you said you had my back so I
Wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you following following following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you following following following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No I just can't get over you
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees

Oh yeah
Maroon 5 - Misery
Oh yeah

So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting here
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad

I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to save me
I never would have made it babe
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here I don't think so
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly

And your lover's screaming loudly

I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
Coz you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here
I don't feel so bad I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry darling

Did I do the wrong thing
Oh what was I thinking

Is his heart still beating

Woah oh ohh
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore
Don't you care about me I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead

Come around here I don't feel so bad

Lost Stars
Adam Levine

Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I saw you out there crying
Just the same

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I saw you out there crying
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?


  I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who¡®s taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
I see but don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Wasted
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Do you think that I should just go home without you

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so

You gotta let it go
'Cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now
Of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you
I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
You never let me go
Got me chained to your touch
Like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true
Afraid to let you go
'Cause without you I'm lost
And no matter the cost
I'm standing next to you
I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling

Don't shoot love, baby

So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights out

So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
Go ahead pull the trigger

And now I'm left with nothing

Asking me for space here in my house

Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different

Woke up swinging from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
searching for the meaning
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind

For my own life,
we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize, it was always you
Can't believe
I couldn't not see it all this time,
all this time
It was always you
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied,satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking by now I know it was always you,always you
All my hidden desires finally came alive
No, I never talk lies to you
