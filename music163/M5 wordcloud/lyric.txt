       Until You're Over Me
 Maroon 5
 
 This relationship is over,
 though my stomach still hurts.
 
 And now I'm gonna live alone,
 Why is the pain much worse?
 
 You're so much better without makeup,
 Why would you hide your face?
 
 Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
 Realize I've made a big mistake.
 
 ohhh...
 I can not refuse your eyes,
 Please don't look at me tonight.
 My heart beats fast I know you're there,
 I pretend like I dont care.
 It hurts so bad to know the truth,
 But I am still in love with you.
 
 I never meant to keep you waiting,
 and now your food is getting cold,
 
 I keep denying I'm in love with you,
 My routine is getting old.
 
 And now you stand up from the table,
 And say you never look back.
 
 do something stupid when you're angry,
 You only wake up sad.
 
 ohhh...
 I can not refuse your eyes,
 Please don't look at me tonight.
 My heart beats fast I know you're there,
 And I pretend like I dont care.
 It hurts so bad to know the truth,
 But I am still in love with you.
 It hurts soo much to know the truth,
 But I am still in love with you.
 
 No more kisses on your lips, tender touch or speach...
 
 I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
 
 And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be??
 
 And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.
 
 I can not refuse your eyes,
 Please don't look at me tonight.
 My heart beats fast I know you're there,
 And I pretend like I dont care.
 
 I can not refuse your eyes,
 Please don't look at me tonight.
 My heart beats fast I know you're there,
 And I pretend like I dont care.
 
 It hurts too much to know the truth,
 But I am still in love with you.
 It hurts too much to know the truth,
 But I am still in love with you.
 
       it's so hard to find you
 i'm standing right behind you
 the streets are much colder
 this mean i'm getting older
 why would you? how could i?
 these questions lead to goodbye
 but now i got my freedom
 don't i?
 i parked my car outside your house
 hope that someday you'll come home
 seems the woman that i love
 is someone that i hardly know
 and after all this time
 i finally found a way to be alone
 i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
 shy girl, so humble
 with eyes that make me stumble
 somehow not speaking lets me know everything
 i go out, you eat in
 hot from the situation
 you're naked in daylight
 wrap yourself up and goodnight
 i'm burning, i'm hungry
 angry cuz she don't love me
 you got me completely
 in my own game you beat me
 i parked my car outside your house
 hope that someday you'll come home
 seems the woman that i love
 is someone that i hardly know
 and after all this time
 i finally found a way to be alone
 i'm terrified i think that i may be losing my mind
 i will be back again
 no this is not the end
 i've fallen hard this time but i not giving in
 i want the world to know that i won't let you forget
 the tears that you shed
 i'll make it impossible to let go
 i parked my car outside your house
 hope that someday you'll come home
 seems the woman that i love
 is someone that i hardly know
 and after all this time
 i finally found a way to be alone
 i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind
 i parked my car outside your house
 hope that someday you'll come home
 seems the woman that i love
 is someone that i hardly know
 and after all this time
 i finally found a place to be alone
 i'm terrified to think that i may be losing my mind

 Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
 Is it better now that I'm not around?

 Glad you got someone new
 Yeah, I see but I don't believe it
 Even in my head you're still in my bed
 Maybe I'm just a fool
 
 Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
 Is it better now that I'm not around?
 My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

 (Oh hey)
 No more police stop
 No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
 No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
 You know just how I make you better on your birthday, oh
 Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this
 Do he let down for you, touch your pria like this
 Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
 Maybe he's right now, but your body's still with me, whoa
 
 I don't wanna know, know, know, know
 Who's taking you home, home, home, home
 I'm loving you so, so, so, so
 The way I used to love you, no

       Maroon5-MissYouLoveYou
 this has not been easy
 this has been hard
 i am scarred
 and i do not know what to do with you.
 go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
 grab your hips, cant remember why i fell in love with this.
 i miss you, i love you
 its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
 oh no
 you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
 you wont be getting my affection again
 oh no
 i dont need you
 who do you think you are?
 no one cares about a name without a face,
 so dont go shooting up the place
 make no mistake the loves not real
 cause the love that i got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
 i miss you, i love you
 its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
 oh no
 you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
 you wont be getting my affection again
 oh no
 cause i dont need you tonight
 it was really nice to know you
 but, theres nothing left to show you
 i got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
 and even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
 discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...
 i miss you, i love you
 its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
 oh no
 you beg me you ask me
 to kiss you and hug you
 you wont be getting my affection again
 oh no, i dont need you
 and i miss you, i love you
 its a shame you cant stay away from me this time
 oh no
 you beg me, you ask me to
 kiss you and hug you
 you wont be getting my affection again
 oh no, i dont need you
       Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial
 For something that I did not do
 And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
 I wouldn't pass right by you
 Maybe it's because you are so insecure
 Maybe your pain don't care
 Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
 I fall so when it's just not there
 Burn another bridge, break another heart
 Try again, it will only fall apart
 Infatuation
 Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 It's such a shame that you shot me down
 It would have been nice to be around
 I'm touching your skin
 If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
 I guess this must be infatuation （I want it…）
 Try to put my finger on what burns me up
 It always seems to escape me
 And when you have decided that you've had enough
 Just tell me where I need to be
 Now her face is something that I never had
 To ever deal with before
 She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
 And I'm the one wanting more
 Burn another bridge, break another heart
 Try again, it will only fall apart
 Infatuation
 Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 It's such a shame that you shot me down
 It would have been nice to be around
 I'm touching your skin
 If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
 And I guess this must be infatuation （I want it…）
 I'm so attracted to you
 The feeling's mutual too
 And I get scared the moment you leave
 Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeh
 Infatuation
 Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 It's such a shame that you shot me down
 It would have been nice to be around
 I'm touching your skin
 If it's only a fancy, then why is it killing me?
 I guess this must be infatuation （I want it…）
 Ooh （I want it…）
 Yeh… （I want it…）
 Infatuation （Bonus Track）
 Do you mean all the things you are?
 Are you pleased with the way things are?
 Wear that dress to protect this scar,
 That only I have seen.
 Do you give just to please yourself?
 Do you wish you were somewhere else?
 Justified all the things you tried,
 said that it was all for me.
 And be near,
 Just for the moment,
 Stay here,
 Never go home.
 Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true,
 It comes true.
 Have you learned all the secrets yet?
 Were you burn by the things I＇ve said?
 Took the dive just to feel alive,
 but never heard the truth.
 Now I＇m in love but I don＇t know how
 I＇m in pain cause I want it now
 As I sit watching her eyes close,
 I slowly open mine.
 And be near,
 Just for the moment,
 Stay here,
 Never go home.
 Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true.
 I am so confused by this.
 I know that life is hit or miss.
 Days are stung by too much sun,
 I think that you may be the one.
 Cover yourself up in me,
 Shrouded in what could have been.
 I will listen to your pain,
 if you listen to me.
 Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
 Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
 And I know, the story of a broken heart comes True,
 Comes true,
 True,
 It comes true,
 True.
 I want you know that everything I ever do is for you.
 
 I'm happy you came to me first
 before the bubble burst
 i'm happy you answered my calls
 i'm bouncing off the walls
 impossible to be tamed
 her need- celophane
 i'm happy you like to play games
 why did you run away?
 we could spend some time together
  what he had he'll never know
    your boyfriend gives you no respect
    and i can see your getting it
 so lets figure it out let's go.
 i'm happy you're so impulsive
 means that your passionate
 im happy you're moving so fast
 but will it ever last
 I know you wanna break free
 from this monotony
 i'm happy you're coming with me
 but by choice its gotta be
   we can spend some time together
  what he has he'll never know
   so figure it out lets go
 I'm happy you're changing your speed
 slow down and lay with me
 on bottom but always discrete
 kneel down and kiss her feet
 i'm happy your going too far
 full strength before we start
 sometimes you make it so hard
 scream loud as we come apart
  figure it out lets go
 figure it out lets
 go
       Ohh I really need to know
 Ohh I really need to know
 Ohh I really need to know
 Ohh Ya gotta let me go
 This time I really need to do things right
 Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night
 Shudder
 I can't believe it, I'm not myself, suddenly I'm thinkin' of no one else
 You make me shudder
 Ohh I really need to know
 Or else you gotta let me go
 Your just a fantasy girl
 In seven parts of the world
 All I want is to be with you always
 I'll give you everything
 Give some attention to me
 All I want is you and me always
 Give me affection
 I need your perfection
 You feel so good
 You make me stutter, stutter
 If I could touch you, I'd never let go
 Now ya got me screaming and I cannot shut up, shut up
 Now I am lying on the bedroom floor barely even speaking
 and I cannot get up, get up
 Ohh I really, I really, I really need to know
 Ya gotta let me go
 Your just a fantasy girl
 In seven parts of the world
 All I want is to be with you always
 I'll give you everything
 Give some attention to me
 All I want is you and me always
 Give me affection
 
 I need your perfection
 You feel so good
 You make me stutter, stutter
 You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
 Gotta stop shaking me up
 I cant eat, cant sleep, can't think, .....
 Your just a fantasy girl

 Making love to a picture frame
 One more time tonight
 You can tell by the lines in her smile
 Something is not right
  Where are you hiding (hiding)
  She's on the outside
  I'm on the inside crying (crying)
 Just another crazy boy
 Hungry for your
     Hot love
     Wrap yourself around me like a
     Warm glove
     The emptiness leaves me and i
     Feel the never need to
     Go back to the way i was
     The way i was
 I tried and tried and tried and tried
 But i have no concept of consequence
 And i'm a master of self defence
 Days get longer
 Life gets shorter
 She rips me like no other
 So oh dripping from head to toe
 I can't make the same mistake
 If you lose my love
 It was yours to take
 Break down your door
 Take a little more
 When i need you around
 And i'm so terrified of leaving
 It's a new low
 Try and pick me up again but
 Let go see how far i get without you
 Desperately need more of your
   ....
       You've been bad' and it goes on and on and on
 Till you come home babe' Till you come home
 You taste past the poison' you learn to love has gone
 I'm all alone baby' I'm all alone
 I'm waiting for something' always waiting
 Feeling nothing' wondering if it'll ever change
 Then I give a little more' oh babe
 Oh give a little more' oh babe
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 Till I get a little more from you baby
 Get a little more from you baby
 You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
 And on and on
 You make it so hard
 I'm waiting for something' always waiting
 Feeling nothing' wondering if it'll ever change
 Then I give a little more' oh babe
 Give a little more' oh babe
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 Till I get a little more from you baby
 Get a little more from you baby
 I have no defense
 I know you're gonna get me in the end
 And I cannot pretend
 I ever want to feel this way again
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 Till i get a little more from you baby
 Get a little more from you baby
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 I'm not falling in love with ya' I'm not falling in love
 Till i get a little more from you baby
 Get a little more from you baby
       Living inside my head
 Pulling my strings
 Letting me think I'm in control
 
 Giving you all of my heart
 Was a good start
 But it turns out you want my soul
 
 I don't know nothing 'bout that
 In fact I don't know nothing at all
 
 I'm tired of proving you right
 By doing everything so wrong
 So tell me what you really want
 'Cause I don't wanna be
 I don't wanna be alone
 
 Pushing me over the edge
 Can't forget those things you said
 Cut to the bone
 
 Go ahead, take your swing
 What did you think?
 I was just gonna roll over, oh no
 
 I don't know nothing 'bout that
 In fact I don't know nothing at all
 
 I'm tired of proving you right
 By doing everything so wrong
 Gotta tell me what you really want
 'Cause I don't wanna be
 No, I don't wanna be alone
 
 I'm putting myself on the line
 I'm tired of wasting my time
 There's got to be a reason why she will not talk to me
 
 I don't know nothing 'bout that
 In fact I don't know nothing at all
 
 So tired of proving you right
 By doing everything so wrong
 
 I don't know nothing 'bout that
 In fact I don't know nothing at all
 
 So tired of proving you right
 By doing everything so wrong
 
 Tell me what you really want
 I don't wanna be
 I don't wanna be alone
 
 
 I'm sure that he could give you everything
 
 Stability and diamond rings
 
 All the things I do not have
 
 I understand you can't handle that
 
 But for everything that I lack
 
 I provide something you almost had
 
 Half flesh that you yearn that grab
 
 Pit of your stomach you're still so sad
 
 So oh, what you gonna do
 
 I'm in love with you
 
 Don't you wanna dance
 
 This may be the last chance
 
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 
 Out of sight not out of mind
 You want the world, I'll give you mine
 
 Cause you're the girl I'll never find
 And I'm the boy you've left behind
 I know you think you're satisfied
 And God knows how hard we try
 I could give you so much more
 So oh, what you gonna do.
 I'm in love with you
 Don't you wanna dance
 This may be the last chance
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 Oh, what am I gonna do
 I don't have to lose
 You're not making sense
 This may be the last chance
 That you get to love me, oh
 You don't make it easy to bring myself a safety
 You tell me that I'm crazy
 But you're the one who makes me this way
 You call me so impulsive
 But that's what makes us so explosive
 So as I burn these photographs
 I wonder if you kept the ones you had
 Keep them locked up somewhere safe
 cause it's the only place you'll see my face
 So oh, what you gonna do
 I'm in love with you
 won't you wanna dance
 This might be the last chance
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 Oh, what am I gonna do
 I don't have to lose
 You're not making sense
 This may be the last chance
 That you get to love me, oh
 This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
 To love you, oh oh oh
 
 
 People never change, they seem to stay the same
 They wear different clothes but play the same games
 Many different ways to say the same thing
 Searching for the right words, the ones that would make you stay
 Exchanging the way things were
 For the way that they should be, yeah
 And choosing these words is saying to her
 The things that she never heard but always deserved
 I figured out what it is all about
 It's you that I could never live without
 You're everything, the air that I breathe
 Stupid not to know it all along
 And everything I ever did was wrong
 Sadly it's too late for sorry
 Oh, I'm not even really sure who made this mess
 And who threw what punch but I could not care less
 All I know is that I'm here and you are not, oh
 Once I put this wasted pride aside, nothing's all I got, oh
 Exchanging the way things were
 For the way that they should be, yeah
 And choosing theses words is saying to her
 The things that she never heard but always deserved
 I figured out what it is all about
 It's you that I could never live without
 You're everything, the air that I breathe
 Stupid not to know it all along
 And everything I ever did was wrong
 Sadly it's too late for sorry
 Oh, somebody make it stop, yeah
 And pick me up, and just dust me off, oh
 The rainy day flood will drown all this love
 Trapped at the bottom now, please dig me up
 I figured out what it is all about
 It's you that I could never live without
 You're everything, the air that I breathe
 Stupid not to know it all along
 And everything I ever did was wrong
 Sadly it's too late for sorry
 I figured out what it is all about
 It's you that I could never live without
 You're everything, the air that I breathe
 Stupid not to know it all along
 And everything I ever did was wrong
 Sadly it's too late for sorry
       So scared of breaking it
 That you won't let it bend
 And I wrote two hundred letters
 I won't ever send
 Somehow it is cut so much
 Deeper than they seem
 You'd rather cover up
 I'd rather let them be
 So let me be
 And I'll set you free
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 Your salty skin and how
 It mixes in with mine
 I'm the way it feels to be
 Completely intertwined
 I'm not that I didn't care
 It's that I didn't know
 It's not what I didn't feel,
 It's what I didn't show
 So let me be
 And I'll set you free
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 Say your faith is shaken
 You may be mistaken
 You keep me wide awake and
 Waiting for the sun
 I'm desperate and confused
 So far away from you
 I'm getting here
 I don't care where I have to go
 Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
 Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
 Why do you do what you do to me yeah
 Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 
 
 
 
 
 Didn't hear what you were saying
 Live on raw emotion, baby
 I answer questions, never maybe
 So I'm not kind if you betray me
 So, who the hell are you to save me
 Never would have made it, babe
 If you needed love
 Well, then, ask for love
 Could have given love
 Now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault
 'Cause you both deserve
 What's coming now
 So don't say a word
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me
 I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here
 I don't think so, yeah
 Would have bled to make you happy
 You didn't need to treat me that way
 And now you beat me at my own game
 And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
 And your lover's screaming loudly
 I hear a sound and hit the ground
 If you needed love
 Well, then, ask for love
 Could have given love
 Now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault
 'Cause you both deserve
 What's coming now
 So don't say a word
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me
 I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I'm so sorry, darling
 Did I do the wrong thing
 Oh, what was I thinking
 Is his heart still beating
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me
 I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 Bad...
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 Bad...
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 Yeah...

 i  just  can't  handle  it.
 this  thing  called  love,
 i  must  get  round  to  it.
 i  ain't  ready,
 crazy  little  thing  called  love

 it  cries （like  a  baby）,
 in  a  cradle  all  night.

 it  shakes  all  over  like  a  jelly  fish,
 i  kind  of  like  it.
 crazy  little  thing  called  love
 there  goes  my  baby,
 she  knows  how  to  rock'n'roll.
 she  drives  me  crazy,
 she  gives  me  hot  and  cold  fever.

 crazy  little  thing  called  love...
       Where you are seems to be
 As far as an eternity
 Outstretched arms, open hearts
 And if it never ends then when do we start?
 I'll never leave you behind
 Or treat you unkind
 I know you understand
 And with a tear in my eye
 Give me the sweetest goodbye
 That I ever did receive
 
 Pushing forward and arching back
 Bring me closer to heart attack
 Say goodbye and just fly away
 When you come back
 I have something to say
 How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
 When you get home
 There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
 So I can show you how I...
 Dream away everyday
 Try so hard to disregard
 The rhythm of the rain that drops
 And coincides with the beating of my heart
 I'll never leave you behind
 Or treat you unkind
 And I know you understand
 And with a tear in my eye
 Give me the sweetest goodbye
 That I ever, ever, ever did receive
 Pushing forward and arching back
 Bring me closer to heart attack
 Say goodbye and just fly away
 You come back
 And I have something to say
 How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
 When you get home
 There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
 So I can show you how I feel
 Feel
 Feel
 Feel
 
 How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
 When you get home
 There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
 So I can show you how I feel
 Show you how I feel
 Show you how I feel
 Show you how, show you, show you
 Show you how I feel
       After school
 Walking home
 Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
 I can smell hot asphalt
 Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
 And I cannot remember
 What life was like through photographs
 Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
 And sometimes it's a sad song
 But I cannot forget
 Refuse to regret
 So glad I met you
 Take my breath away
 Make everyday
 Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
 And mama I've been cryin'
 Cause things ain't how they used to be
 She said, the battle's almost won
 And we're only several miles from the sun
 
 Moving on down my street
 I see people I won't ever meet
 I think of her, take a breath
 Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
 And sometimes its a sad song
 But I cannot forget
 Refuse to regret
 So glad I met you
 Take my breath away
 Make everyday
 Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
 And mama I've been cryin'
 Cause things ain't how they used to be
 She said, the battle's almost won
 And we're only several miles from the sun
 The rhythm of the conversation
 The perfection of her creation
 The sex she slipped into my coffee
 The way she felt when she first saw me
 Hate to love and love to hate her
 Like a broken record player
 Back and forth and here and gone
 and on and on and on and on
 But I cannot forget
 Refuse to regret
 So glad I met you
 Take my breath away
 Make everyday
 Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
 And mama I've been cryin'
 Cause things ain't how they used to be
 She said, the battle's almost won
 And we're only several miles
 Said, the battle's almost won
 And we're only several miles from the sunThe Sun

       when  you  refuse  me
 you  confuse  me
 what  makes  you  think  i'll  let  you  in  again?
 think  again  my  friend
 go  on  misuse  me  and  abuse  me
 i'll  come  out  stronger  in  the  end
 does  it  make  you  sad
 to  find  yourself  alone?
 does  it  make  you  mad
 to  find  that  i  have  grown?
 bet  it  hurts  so  bad
 to  see  the  strength  that  i  have  shown
 when  you  answer  the  door,pick  up  the  phone,
 you  won't  find  me 'cause  i'm  not  coming  home
 you  do  not  know  how  much  this  hurts  me
 to  say  these  things  that  i  don't  want  to  say
 but  have  to  say  them  anyway
 i  would  do  anything  to  end  your  suffering
 but  you  would  rather  walk  away
 does  it  make  you  sad
 to  find  yourself  alone?
 does  it  make  you  mad
 to  find  that  i  have  grown?
 i'll  bet  it  hurts  so  bad
 to  see  the  strength  that  i  have  shown
 when  you  answer  the  door,pick  up  the  phone,
 you  won't  find  me 'cause  i'm  not  coming  home
 does  it  make  you  sad
 to  find  yourself  alone?（find  yourself  alone）
 does  it  make  you  mad
 to  find  that  i  have  grown?
 does  it  make  you  sad
 to  find  yourself  alone?
 does  it  make  you  mad
 to  see  how  i  have  grown?
 bet  it  hurts  so  bad
 to  see  the  strength  that  i  have  shown
 when  you  answer  the  door,pick  up  the  phone,
 you  won't  find  me 'cause  i'm  not  coming  home

 Sunday morning ，rain is falling
 Steal some covers ，share some skin
 Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
 You twist to fit the mold that I am in
 But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
 And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
 That someday it would lead me back to you
 That someday it would lead me back to you
 （Someday）
 That may be all I need
 In darkness, she is all I see
 Come and rest your bones with me
 Driving slow on Sunday morning
 And I never want to leave
 Fingers trace your every outline
 Paint a picture with my hands
 Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
 Change the weather, still together when it ends
 That may be all I need
 In darkness, she is all I see
 Come and rest your bones with me
 Driving slow on Sunday morning
 And I never want to leave
 Oh..yeah.But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
 （life gets hard to do）
 Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
 Singing, Someday it'll bring me back to you.
 Find a way to bring myself back home to you
 May not know that may be all I need
 In darkness, she is all I see
 Come and rest your bones with me
 Driving slow on Sunday morning
 Driving slow......
 I am a flower in your hair
 I am a flower in your hair
       Beauty queen of only eighteen
 She had some trouble with herself
 He was always there to help her
 She always belonged to someone else
 I drove for miles and miles
 And wound up at your door
 I've had you so many times
 But somehow I want more
 I don't mind spending everyday
 Out on your corner in the pouring rain
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
 Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 Tap on my window knock on my door
 I want to make you feel beautiful
 I know I tend to get so insecure
 It doesn't matter anymore
 It's not always rainbows and butterflies
 It's compromise that moves us along
 My heart is full and my door's always open
 You come anytime you want
 I don't mind spending everyday
 Out on your corner in the pouring rain
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
 Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 I know where you hide alone in your car
 Know all of the things that make you who you are
 I know that goodbye means nothing at all
 Comes back and begs me to catch her everytime she falls
 Tap on my window knock on my door
 I want to make you feel beautiful
 I don't mind spending everyday
 Out on your corner in the pouring rain
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
 Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 I don't mind spending everyday
 Out on your corner in the pouring rain
 I tried so hard to say good-bye
 I'm full of regret
 For all things that I've done and said
 And I don't know if it'll ever be ok to show
 My face 'round here
 Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
 Would you ever turn your head and look
 See if I'm gone
 Cause I fear
 There is nothing left to say to you
 That you wanna hear
 That you wanna know
 I think I should go
 The things I've done are way too shameful
 Your just innocent
 A helpless victim of a spider's web
 And I'm an insect
 Goin after anything that I can get
 So you better turn your head and run
 And don't look back
 Cause I fear
 There is nothing left to say
 To you
 That you wanna hear
 That you wanna know
 I think I should go
 The things I've done are way too shameful
 And I've done you so wrong
 Treated you bad
 Strung you along
 Oh shame on myself
 I don't know how I got so tangled up
 
       I was so high
 I did not recognize
 The fire burning in her eyes
 The chaos that controlled my mind
 Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
 Never to return again
 But always in my heart
 This love has taken it's toll on me
 She said Goodbye
 Too many times before
 And her heart is breaking in front of me
 I have no choice
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 I tried my best to feed her appetite
 Keep her coming every night
 So hard to keep her satisfied
 Kept playing love like it was just a game
 Pretending to feel the same
 Then turn around and leave again
 This love has taken its toll on me
 She said Goodbye
 Too many times before
 And her heart is breaking in front of me
 I have no choice
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 I'll fix these broken things
 Repair your broken wings
 And make sure everything's alright
 It's all right, It's all right
 My pressure on your hips
 Sinking my fingertips
 Into every inch of you
 Cause I know that's what you want me to do
 This love has taken its toll on me
 She said Goodbye
 Too many times before
 And her heart is breaking in front of me
 I have no choice
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 This love has taken its toll on me
 She said Goodbye
 Too many times before
 My heart is breaking in front of me
 She said Goodbye
 Too many times before
 Ohooo.....Yeah....
       How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
 So condescending, unnecessarily critical
 I have the tendency of getting very physical
 So watch your step, cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
 You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
 The double vision I was seeing, is finally clear
 You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
 Not fit to fuckin tread the ground I am walking on
 
 When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
 You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
 and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 
 What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
 You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
 Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
 Hoping somebody, someday, will do you like I did
 
 When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
 You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
 and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 
 Does it kill
 Does it burn
 Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control
 Does it thrill
 Does it sting
 When you feel what I bring and you wish you had me to hold
 When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
 You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
 and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
 
 Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
       I've been the needle and the thread
 Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
 I try to laugh but cry instead
 Patiently wait to hear the words you ve never said
 Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I looking was for
 Try to guide me in the right direction
 Making use of all this time
 Keeping everything inside
 Close my eyes and listen cry to you
 I'm lifting you up
 I'm letting you down
 I'm dancing til dawn
 I'm fooling around
 I'm not giving up
 I'm making your love
 This city s made us crazy and we must get out
 This not goodbye she said
 It is just time for me to rest my head
 She does not walk she runs instead
 Down these jagged streets and into my bed
 Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
 Try to guide me in the right direction
 Making use of all this time
 Keeping everything inside
 Close my eyes and listen to you cry
 I'm lifting you up
 I'm letting you down
 I'm dancing til dawn
 I'm fooling around
 I'm not giving up
 I'm making your love
 This city s made us crazy and we must get out
 There s only so much I can do for you
 After all of the things you put me through
 I'm lifting you up
 I'm letting you down
 I'm dancing til dawn
 I'm fooling around
 I'm not giving up
 I'm making your love
 This city  made us crazy and we must get out
 I'm lifting you up
 I'm letting you down
 I'm dancing til dawn
 I'm fooling around
 I'm not giving up
 I'm making your love
 This city  made us crazy and we must get out
 whoa
 I'm dancing til dawn
 I'm fooling around
 I'm not giving up
 I'm making your love
 This city made us crazy and we must get out
 yeahh...
 oh...
 some people live for the fortune
 some people live for the fame
 some people live for the power yeah
 some people live just to play the game
 some people think that the physical things
 define what's within
 
 i've been there before
 but that life's a bore
 so full of the superficial
 some people want it all
 but i don't want at nothing all
 if it ain't you baby
 if i ain't got you baby
 some people want diamond rings
 some just want everything
 but everything means nothing
 if i ain't got you
 some people search for a fountain
 promises forever young
 some people need three dozen roses
 
 and that's the only way to prove you love them
 and in a world on a silver platter
 and wondering what it means
 no one to share' no one who truly cares for me
 some people want it all
 but i don't want nothing at all
 
 if it ain't you baby
 if i ain't got you baby
 some people want diamond rings
 some just want everything
 but everything means nothing
 if i ain't got you
 some people want it all
 but i don't want nothing at all
 
 if it ain't you baby
 if i ain't got you baby
 some people want diamond rings
 some just want everything
 but everything means nothing
 if i ain't got you
 if i ain't got you with me baby
 nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
 if i ain't got you with me baby
 Maroon 5
 Through With You
 Can you see me
 Floating above your head
 As you lay in bed
 Thinking about everything
 That you did not do
 Cause saying I love you
 Has nothing to do with meaning it
 ...
 And I don't trust you
 Cause every time you're here
 Your intentions are unclear
 I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
 That I know will never come
 I used to think you were the one
 Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
 You ain't ever coming back to me
 That's not how things were supposed to be
 You take my hand just to give it back
 No other lover has ever done that
 Do you remember
 The way we used to melt
 Do you remember how it felt
 When I touched you
 Oh cause I remember very well
 Oh Oh
 And how long has it been
 Since someone you let in
 Has given what I gave to you?
 ...
 And at night when you sleep
 Do you dream I would be there
 Just for a minute or two do you?
 You ain't ever coming back to me
 That's not how things were supposed to be
 You take my hand just to give it back
 No other lover has ever done that
 Heartache heartache I just have so much
 A simple love with a complex touch
 There is nothing you can say or do
 I called to let you know I'm through with you
 ...
 You ain't ever coming back to me
 That's not how things were supposed to be
 You take my hand just to give it back
 No other lover has ever done that
 Heartache heartache I just have so much
 A simple love with a complex touch
 There is nothing you can say or do
 I called to let you know I'm through
 I called to let you know I'm through
 I called to let you know I'm through with you
 I ain't never coming back to you
 
 Watch the sunrise
 Say your goodbyes
 Off we go
 Some conversation
 No contemplation
 Hit the road
 Car overheats
 Jump out of my seat
 On the side of the highway, baby
 Our road is long
 Your hold is strong
 Please don't ever let it go
 Oh no
 I know I don't know you
 But I want you so bad
 Everyone has a secret
 Oh, can they keep it
 Oh, no they can't
 I'm driving fast now
 Don't think I know how to go slow
 Oh, where you at now
 I feel around
 There you are
 Cool these engines
 Calm these jets
 I ask you, "How hot can it get?"
 And as you wipe off beads of sweat
 Slowly, you say, "I'm not there yet."
 I know I don't know you
 But I want you so bad
 Everyone has a secret
 Oh, can they keep it
 Oh, no they can't
 I know I don't know you
 But I want you so bad
 Everyone has a secret
 Oh, but can they keep it
 Oh, no they can't
 
       Cold enough to chill my bones
 It feels like I don't know you anymore
 I don't understand why you're so cold to me
 With every breath you breathe
 I see there's something going on
 I don't understand why you're so cold
 
 Are we taking time or a time out?
 I can't take the in-between
 Asking me for space here in my house
 You know how to fuck with me
 Acting like we're not together
 After everything that we've been through
 Sleeping up under the covers
 How am I so far away from you?
 
 Distant, when we're kissing
 Feel so different
 Baby tell me how did you get so
 
 Cold enough to chill my bones
 It feels like I don't know you anymore
 I don't understand why you're so cold to me
 With every breath you breathe
 I see there's something going on
 I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
 Woah, yeah
 Woah, yeah
 I don't understand why you're so cold
 
 What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
 If you wanna leave just leave
 Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
 The silence is killing me
 Acting like we're not together
 If you don't want this, then what's the use?
 Sleeping up under the covers
 How am I so far away from you?
 
 Distant, when we're kissing
 Feel so different
 Baby tell me how did you get so
 
 Cold enough to chill my bones
 It feels like I don't know you anymore
 I don't understand why you're so cold to me
 With every breath you breathe
 I see there's something going on
 I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
 Woah, yeah
 Woah, yeah
 I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 I don't understand why you're so cold
 
 Never thought that you were like this
 I took the tag off and made you priceless
 I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
 Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
 Tryna stay, and I leave
 Saying that you need some time to breath
 Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
 But the four letter word don't sleep
 We goin' two separate ways
 You ain't been actin' the same
 You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
 You gold dig every day
 I switched the four door to the two door
 'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
 Girl I tried to give you space
 Baby tell me how did you get so
 
 Cold enough to chill my bones
 It feels like I don't know you anymore
 I don't understand why you're so cold to me
 With every breath you breathe
 I see there's something going on
 I don't understand why you're so cold
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 Woah, yeah
 So fuck this cold world
 I don't understand why you're so cold
 
 Shiver
 build me You up
 You knock me down
 Provoke a smile
 And make me frown
 You are the queen of runaround
 You know it's true
 You chew me up
 And spit me out
 Enjoy the taste
 I leave in your mouth
 You look at me
 I look at you
 Neither of us know what to do
 There may not
 Be another way to your heart
 So I guess I'd better find a new way in
 I shiver when I hear your name
 Think about you but it's not the same
 I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin
 Immobilized by the thought of you
 Paralyzed by the sight of you
 Hypnotized by the words you say
 Not true but I believe em anyway
 So come to bed It's getting late
 There's no more time for us to waste
 Remember how my body tastes
 You feel your heart begin to race
 There may not
 your to Be another way heart
 So I guess I'd better find a new way in
 I shiver when I hear your name
 Think about you but it's not the same
 I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
 There may not
 Be another way to your heart
 So I guess I'd better find a new way in
 I shiver when I hear your name
 Think about you but it's not the same
 I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
 Be another way to your heart
 So I guess I'd better find a new way in
 I shiver when I hear your name
 Think about you but it's not the same
 I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
 
       Oh yeah
 Oh yeah
 
 So scared of breaking it
 That you won't let it bend
 And I wrote two hundred letters
 I won't ever send
 Somehow it is cut so much
 Deeper than they seem
 You'd rather cover up
 I'd rather let them be
 So let me be
 And I'll set you free
 
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 
 Your salty skin and how
 It mixes in with mine
 I'm the way it feels to be
 Completely intertwined
 I'm not that I didn't care
 It's that I didn't know
 It's not what I didn't feel,
 It's what I didn't show
 So let me be
 And I'll set you free
 
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 
 Say your faith is shaken
 You may be mistaken
 You keep me wide awake and
 Waiting for the sun
 I'm desperate and confused
 So far away from you
 I'm getting here
 I don't care where I have to go
 Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
 Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
 Why do you do what you do to me yeah
 Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
 
 I am in misery
 There ain't nobody
 Who can comfort me
 Why won't you answer me?
 Your silence is slowly killing me
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 
 Girl you really got me bad
 You really got me bad
 I'm gonna get you back
 Gonna get you back
 
 
 
 
 
 Woah
 This love has taken its toll on me
 She said Goodbye too many times before
 And her heart is breaking in front of me
 I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 
 I was so high I did not recognize
 The fire burning in her eyes
 The chaos that controlled my mind
 Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
 Never to return again
 But always in my heart
 This love has taken its toll on me
 She said Goodbye too many times before
 And her heart is breaking in front of me
 I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
 Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

 Repair your broken wings
 And make sure everything's alright
 My pressure on your hips
 Sinking my fingertips
 Into every inch of you
 Cause I know that's what you want me to do
 
 That she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 And she will be loved
 Loved... yeah...

 Woman
 Singer:Maroon 5
 
 Woman
 If i'd be so inclined to climb up beside you,
 would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
 And if I should ever find the key you hide so well,
 will you tell me that I can spend the night?
 Leaving your smell on my coat
 Leaving your taste on my shoulder
 I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
 Yeah,yeah,oh,woah,woah,woah,woah,woah,wa. Oh no.
 If l could bottle up the chills that you gave me,
 I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
 And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman,
 It is you that would come flowing from my pen, yeah.
 Leaving your clothes on my floor,
 making me walk out the door and,
 I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
 Oooo,oo,oo oo,oo,oo,oo,oh,woah,oo,oh,oo,woah.
 Fail to understand what it is about this woman.
 Aey,ee,aey,aey,mmm
 Music
 Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun,
 As she burns me,I am screaming loud for more.
 I drink every drop of liquid heat that i've become.
 Pop me open spill me out onto the floor.
 Leaving your smell on my coat,
 Leaving your taste on my shoulder
 I still fail to understand, fail to understand.
 Leaving your smell on my coat,
 Leaving your taste on my shoulder
 I still fail to understand what it is about this woman.
 Yeah,woo,yeah,woooo

 Calm me down, calm me down
 
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
 I will never walk away again

 So come here and never leave this place
 Perfection of your face
 Slows me down, slows me down
 
 So fall down
 I need you to trust me
 Go easy, don't rush me
 Help me out
 Why don't you help me out
 
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,

 So you say go
 It isn't worth it
 And I say no
 It isn't perfect
 So I stay and still
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 I'd give it all away just to get you back
 And fake it, fake it
 I'll take what I can get
 Knocking so loud
 Can you hear me yet?
 Try to stay awake
 But you can't forget
 
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
 I will never walk away again
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 
 You say go
 It isn't worth it
 And I say no
 It isn't perfect
 So I stay and still
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 
 Take it, take it all，Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all，Take all that I have
       You and I go hard,
 at each other like we going to war
 You and I go rough,
 we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
 You and I get sore,
 then dysfunctional we stuck keeping score
 You and I get sick,
 they all know that we can't do this no more
 But baby there you again,
 there you again making me love you
 Yeah I stopped using my head,
 using my head let it all go
 Got you stuck on my body,
 on my body like a tattoo
 And now i'm feeling stupid,
 feeling stupid crawling back to you
 So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
 that i'll only stay with you one more night
 And I know i've said it a million times
 But i'll only stay with you one more night
 Trying to tell you no,
 but my body keeps on telling you yes
 Trying to tell you stop,
 but your lipstick got me so out of breath
 I'd be waking up,
 in the morning probably hating myself
 And i'd be waking up,
 feeling sastified but guilty as hell
 But baby there you again,
 there you again making me love you
 Yeah I stopped using my head,
 using my head let it all go
 Got you stuck on my body,
 on my body like a tattoo
 And now i'm feeling stupid,
 feeling stupid crawling back to you
 So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
 that i'll only stay with you one more night
 And I know i've said it a million times
 But i'll only stay with you one more night
 Yeah baby give me one more night
 Yeah baby give me one more night
 Yeah baby give me one more night
 But baby there you again,
 there you again making me love you
 Yeah I stopped using my head,

 that i'll only stay with you one more night
 And I know i've said it a million times
 But i'll only stay with you one more night
 (yeah baby give me one more night)
 So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,
 that i'll only stay with you one more night
 And I know i've said it a million times
 But i'll only stay with you one more night
       
 
 You say you need someone
 But everybody does
 I＇m no different than you
 I just believe what I do
 You point your finger at
 Everyone but yourself
 And blame the ones that you love
 Who＇re only tryin＇ to help
 
 As it＇s winding down to zero
 I am yours like a hero
 I＇ll see this through
 There＇s so much me and you
 Take this enemy together
 Fight these demons off forever
 Forever
 Forever
 Forever
 
 5,4,3,2,1
 I won＇t stop until it＇s done
 No curtain call,
 I will not fall
 This may be the one
 We＇ve been waiting for
 No curtain call,
 Just take it all
 
 I have no time for fear
 Or people in my ear
 Head down and running so fast
 Try not to dwell on the past
 I＇m fighting through this pain
 And things I cannot change
 Running right into the flame
 Rather than running away
 
 As it＇s winding down to zero
 I am yours like a hero
 I＇ll see this through
 There＇s so much me and you
 Take this enemy together
 Fight these demons off forever
 Forever
 Forever
 Forever
 
 5,4,3,2,1
 I won＇t stop until it＇s done
 No curtain call,
 I will not fall
 This may be the one
 We＇ve been waiting for
 No curtain call,
 Just take it all
 
 Sweat drips down from every angle
 Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
 You turn up the heat
 Tossin and turnin, you cannot sleep
 Quietly weep,you＇re in too deep
 
 5,4,3,2,1
 I won＇t stop until it＇s done
 No curtain call,
 I will not fall
 This may be the one
 We＇ve been waiting for
 No curtain call,
 Just take it all
 5,4,3,2,1
 I won＇t stop until it＇s done
 No curtain call,
 I will not fall
 This may be the one
 We＇ve been waiting for
 No curtain call,
 Just take it all
 
 
 
 
 Wasted Years虚度的年头
 Slow is the memory心里象在慢放
 I can picture her standing right in front of me我能想像她站在我眼前的画面
 I said that I'd behaving badly我说我之前做得不好
 Kinda driving her crazy有点把她逼疯
 But I know she wants me但我知道她想我
 I remember everything我记得很清楚
 Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane她的汗水，有甘蔗的甜
 And sit on top me, yelling out my fucking name像骑马一样，大声叫那该死的名称
 Until I'm empty直到我觉得变得很空才结束
 And I know she wants me我就知道她想我
 But I have already tried to explain myself但我啊，已经在找借口
 It's not that I love someone else我不是心里还有别人
 But I can't bear to listen to you cry又不敢看到你哭的样子
 I'm sick of all these wasted years想起浪费了那些年就不舒服
 Drown in someone else's tears成天淹没在什么人的泪水里
 You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry你既然这样，我就要让你尝尝吹风晾干的感觉
 Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah哇啊
 And I'll see you when I get back要不我回来的时候见见你
 Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track或许我们还能让关系重回正轨
 You touch me there because you know how much I like that因为你知道我多么喜欢这样，你触碰我恰到好处
 I think that we both need to relax我觉得要不我们好好放松一下
 You know you want me你很明白你想我
 All the time and everywhere每时每刻每处
 A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there表面和平，内心反抗
 And the worst thing is that I don't even really care最糟的是我根本不是真的在乎
 And the emptiness is too much to bear空空的感觉太难忍受
 But I have already tried to explain myself但我啊，已经在找借口
 It's not that I love someone else我不是心里还有别人
 But I can't bear to listen to you cry又不敢看到你哭的样子
 I'm sick of all these wasted years想起浪费了那些年就不舒服
 Drown in someone else's tears成天淹没在什么人的泪水里
 You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry你既然这样，我就要让你尝尝吹风晾干的感觉
 'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do因为有时我真毫无头绪
 I'm standing, standing right in front of you我站，正站在你面前
 And pray our pain subsides而在祈祷我们之间的伤痛消逝
 Can't bare the stare of your teary eyes你眼泪旺旺看着我，消受不住
 I know you feel like it's hard to stay我知道你感觉呆在一起很痛苦
 In fact you may just wanna run away实际上你可能还想着跑开
 Now all that I can really say is baby, oh现在我能说的就是“Baby, oh
 Deep down you know that你心里其实明白
 I have already tried to explain myself
 It's not that I love someone else
 But I can't bear to listen to you cry
 Cry, I'm sick of all these wasted years
 Drown in someone else's tears
 You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
 I have already tried to explain myself
 It's not that I love someone else
 But I can't bear to listen to you cry
 Cry, sick of all these wasted years
 Drown in someone else's tears
 You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
 Oh no no no
 Oh no no no
 (We tried, yeah)

 Lyric on Metrolyrics
 I'm sure that he could give you everything
 Stability and diamond rings
 All the things I do not have
 I understand you can't handle that
 But for everything that I lack
 I provide something you almost had
 Half flesh that you yearn that grab
 Pit of your stomach you're still so sad
 So oh, what you gonna do.
 I'm in love with you
 Don't you wanna dance
 This may be the last chance
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 Out of sight not out of mind
 You want the world, I'll give you mine
 Cause you're the girl I'll never find
 And I'm the boy you've left behind
 I know you think you're satisfied
 And God knows how hard we try
 But if you showed up at my door
 I could give you so much more
 So oh, what you gonna do
 I'm in love with you
 Don't you wanna dance
 This may be the last chance
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 Oh, what am I gonna do
 I don't have to lose
 You're not making sense
 This may be the last chance
 That you get to love me, oh
 You don't make it easy to bring myself a safety
 You tell me that I'm crazy
 But you're the one who makes me this way
 You call me so impulsive
 But that's what makes us so explosive
 So as I burn these photographs
 I wonder if you kept the ones you had
 Keep them locked up somewhere safe
 cause it's the only place you'll see my face
 So oh, what you gonna do
 I'm in love with you
 won't you wanna dance
 This might be the last chance
 That I get to love you, oh oh oh
 Oh, what am I gonna do
 I don't have to lose
 You're not making sense
 This may be the last chance
 That you get to love me, oh
 This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
 To love you, oh oh oh
       Just you shoot for the stars
 If it feels right
 And in for my heart
 If you feel like
 Can take me away
 And make it okay
 I swear i'll behave
 
 You wanted control
 Sure we waited
 I put on a show
 Now I make it
 You say i'm a kid
 My ego is big
 I don't give a shit
 And it goes like this
 
 Take me by the tongue
 And i'll know you
 Kiss till you're drunk
 And i'll show you
 Want the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger
 
 I don't even try to control you
 Look into my eyes and i'll own you
 With the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger
 
 Baby it's hard
 And it feel like you're broken in scar
 Nothing feels right
 But when you're with me
 I make you believe
 That i've got the key
 
 So get in the car
 We can ride it
 Wherever you want
 Get inside it
 And you want to stir
 But i'm shifting gears
 I'll take it from here
 And it goes like this
 
 Take me by the tongue
 And i'll know you
 Kiss till you're drunk
 And i'll show you
 Want the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger
 
 I don't even try to control you
 Look into my eyes and i'll own you
 With the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger
 
 You want to know how to make me smile
 Take control, own me just for the night
 But if I share my secret
 You gonna have to keep it
 Nobody else can see this
 
 So watch and learn
 I won't show you twice
 Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
 But if I share my secret
 You gonna have to keep it
 Nobody else can see this
 
 And it goes like this
 
 Take me by the tongue
 And i'll know you
 Kiss till you're drunk
 And i'll show you
 Want the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger
 
 I don't even try to control you
 Look into my eyes and i'll own you
 With the moves like jagger
 I got the moves like jagger
 I got the mooooooves like jagger

 If I fell in love with you
 Would you promise to be true
 And help me understand
 Cause I've been in love before
 And I've found that love was more
 Than just holding hands
 If I give my heart to you
 I must be sure from the very start
 That you would love me more than her
 If I trust in you
 Oh now please don't run and hide
 If I love you too
 Oh please don't hurt my pride like her
 Cause I couldn't stand the pain
 And I would be sad if I knew love was in vain
 So I hope you'll see
 That I would love to love you
 And that she will cry
 When she learns we are two
 Cause I couldn't stand the pain
 And I would be sad if I knew love was in vain
 So I hope you'll see
 That I would love to love you
 And that she will cry
 When she learns we are two
 If I fell in love with you
       She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
 And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
 I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
 It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
 And you had to wait for in it, when your daddy didn't know
 You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
 Such a bu-bu-bu snob that you'll never know the truth
 The perfect on me answer, but nothing at the call
 It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
 Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
 But your perfect little body makes me fall apart, your perfect little body makes me fall apart
 She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
 And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
 I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
 I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
 Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
 I try not to give in, but temptation got me lost
 So I will do my best to get you all
 The perfect on me answer, but nothing at the call
 It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
 Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
 But your perfect little body makes me fall apart, your perfect little body makes me fall apart
 She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
 And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
 I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
 Yeah...
 She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
 And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
 I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
 She's got tickets to her own show but nobody wants to go
 And i'm stuck sitting in the front row
 I'm singing alone like there's no tomorrow
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
 La la la la la la la laaaaaa
       I'm not a fortune teller
 I won't be bringing news of what tomorrow brings
 I'll leave that up to you
 I'm not a fortune teller
 Don't have crystal ball
 I can't predict the future
 Can't see nothing at all
 It doesn't mean i'm afraid of all the things that you say
 But I just think we should stay
 Stuck in the moment today
 And as the seasons roll back
 No matter how hard I try
 Some of it will end and the leaves will turn again
 
 I don't know why you're acting like this
 I don't know why you have to do it again
 Why you have to go, and ruin the night
 Don't worry about tomorrow's miss
 
 I never know how the future will go
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 I never change, but I want you to stay
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 
 I don't like watching TV
 I don't know what that all means
 And your american dream, baby it just stays in me
 I know what i'm thinking, may not be in your mind
 I know the song i'm singing, it's not your favorite kind
 It doesn't mean i'm afraid of all the things that you say
 But I just think we should stay
 Stuck in the moment today
 And as the seasons roll back
 No matter how hard I try
 Some of it will end and the leaves will turn again
 
 I don't know why you're acting like this
 I don't know why you have to do it again
 Why you have to go, and ruin the night
 Don't worry about tomorrow's miss
 
 I never know how the future will go
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 I never change, but I want you to stay
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 
 This feeling, keeps growing, these rivers keep flowing
 How can I have answers when you drive me in questions
 
 I never know how the future will go
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 I never change, but I want you to stay
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 
 I never know how the future will go
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 I never change, but I want you to stay
 I don't know what to tell you, i'm not a fortune teller
 
       I know your inside, you're feeling so hollow
 And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
 But if I fall for you, i'll never recover
 If I fall for you, i'll never be the same
 I really want to love somebody
 I really want to dance the night away
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 I really want to touch somebody
 I think about you every single day
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 You're such a hard act for me to follow
 Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
 But if I fall for you, i'll never recover
 If I fall for you, i'll never be the same
 I really want to love somebody
 I really want to dance the night away
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 I really want to touch somebody
 I think about you every single day
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I don't know where to start, i'm just a little lost
 I wanna feel like we never gone, ever stopped
 I don't what to do, i'm right in front of you
 Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah
 I really want to love somebody
 I really want to dance the night away
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 I really want to touch somebody
 I think about you every single day
 I know we're only half way there
 But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 You take me all the way, you take me all the way
 Baby it's not alright
 The second that you turn your back she'll me outta sight
 Baby she'll break your heart, the second that you spend the night apart
 How could you do it? oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made
 How could you do it?, oh you better watch yourself
 I think that girl's insane
 
 Ooooh
 She's in it just to win it
 Don't trust her for a minute
 Ooooh
 It's a like cheap thriller
 She's such a ladykiller
 
 
 Baby she'll eat alive, as soon as she smells your blood in the water
 You better run to survive, before she makes you her latest slaughter
 How could you do it? oh, just come back to me, baby i'm begging please
 How could you do it?, oh she knows I love you still, you're just a ladies killer
 
 Ooooh
 She's in it just to win it
 Don't trust her for a minute
 Ooooh
 It's a like cheap thriller
 She's such a ladykiller
 
 
 Ooooh
 She's in it just to win it
 Don't trust her for a minute
 Ooooh
 It's a like cheap thriller
 She's such a ladykiller
 
 Ooooh
 She's in it just to win it
 Don't trust her for a minute
 Ooooh
 It's a like cheap thriller
 She's such a ladykiller
 
 
 
       I count the ways I let you down
 All my fingers and toes but i'm running out
 Clever words can't help me now
 I tipped you attack but you're slipping out
 And I remember your eyes were so bright
 When I first I met you,so in love that night
 And now i'm kissing your tears goodnight
 And I can't take it,you're even perfect when you cry
 Beautiful goodbye,bye,bye
 It's dripping from your eyes,your beautiful goodbye
 It's dripping from your eyes,oh yeah
 When did the rain become a storm
  when did the cloud begin to fall
 Yeah we got knocked out of course by a natural force
 And well,we'll be swimming when it's gone
 And I remember your eyes were so bright
 When I first I met you,so in love that night
 And now i'm kissing your tears goodnight
 And I can't take it,you're even perfect when you cry
 Beautiful goodbye,bye,bye
 It's dripping from your eyes,your beautiful goodbye
 It's dripping from your eyes,oh yeah
 All the pain you try to hide
 Chose your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes
 And let them go,let them fly
 Holding back,won't turn back time

 Your eyes were so bright
 And I remember your eyes were so bright
 And I remember your eyes were so bright
 When I first I met you,so in love that night
 And now i'm kissing your tears goodnight

       You're such a motivator, I gotta get you where
 So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
 You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
 Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
 And I can't wait another minute
 I can't take the look she's giving
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million
 My lucky strike
 Got me so high, and then she dropped me
 But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
 Took me inside and then she rocked me
 She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million, my lucky strike
 Stuck in an elevator, she take me to the sky
 And I don't wanna go down, go down
 She said i'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
 She make me want her right now right now
 And I can't wait another minute
 I can't take the look she's giving
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million
 My lucky strike
 Got me so high, and then she dropped me
 But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
 Took me inside and then she rocked me
 She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million, my lucky strike
 Hey, you're taking all my pain away
 You're shaking like an earthquake
 Hey, you're taking all my pain away
 You're shaking like an earthquake
 Got me so high, and then she dropped me
 But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
 Took me inside and then she rocked me
 She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Oh oh oh my lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night

 Man, it's been a long day
 Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
 Wondering if I really tried everything I could
 Not knowing if I should try a little harder
 Oh, but i'm scared to tell
 That there may not be another one like this
 And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
 And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
 The words that you needed so bad
 And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
 I'm so sad, saaad
 
 Man, it's been a long night
 Just sitting here, trying not to look back
 Still looking at the road we never drove on
 And wondering if the one I chose was the right one
 Oh, but i'm scared to tell
 That there may not be another one like this
 And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
 And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
 The words that you needed so bad
 And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
 I'm so sad, saaad
 
 I'm so sad, so sad
 
 Oh, but i'm scared to tell
 That there may not be another one like this
 And I confess that i'm only holding on by a thin thin threat
 And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
 The words that you needed so bad
 And i'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you the place that you needed to held
 And i'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
 The words that you needed so bad
 I'm so sad, so sad
 
       Here I am waiting, i'll have to leave soon
 Why am i, holding on?
 We knew this would come, we knew it all along
 How did it, come so fast?
 This is our last night but it's late
 And i'm trying not to sleep
 Cause I know, when I wake, I will have to slip away
 And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
 But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
 Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
 But tonight I need to hold you so close
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 Here I am staring at your perfection
  In my arms, so beautiful
 The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
 Somebody slow it down
 This is way too hard, cause I know
 When the sun comes out, I will leave
 This is my last glance that will soon be memory
 And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
 But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
 Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
 But tonight I need to hold you so close
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 I never wanted to stop because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
 I was afraid of the dark but now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
 And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
 But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
 Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
 But tonight I need to hold you so close
 And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
 But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
 Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
 But tonight I need to hold you so close
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
 Oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah)
 Oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah (yeah), oh-woah!
 
       Oh, yeah, oh yeah
 
 Hey you, don't want to love you on the telephone
 You're hanging up and now I am all alone
 Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
 And now I wanna fan you but you're off the run
 My heart's exploding like a burning some
 I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts
 
 Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night
 You're shining like a neon light
 I like you up, when I get inside
 So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now
 We're putting on a show for the crowd
 So turn it up baby make it loud
 
 Hey you, say that you're only having fun and then
 You call me up at 3am again
 Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
 And now all that I got is just a microphone
 To let you know that I am all alone
 I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts
 
 Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night
 You're shining like a neon light
 I like you up, when I get inside
 So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now

 So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
 I wanna be with you all night, in the car let's go

 Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night

 So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now
 We're putting on a show for the crowd
 So turn it up baby make it loud
 
       I'm at a payphone trying to call home
 All of my change I spent on you
 Where have the times gone
 Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
 Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
 The people we used to be
 It's even harder to picture
 That you're not here next to me
 You say it's too late to make it
 But is it too late to try?
 And in our time that you wasted
 All of our bridges burned down
 I've wasted my nights
 You turned out the lights
 Now i'm paralyzed
 Still stucked in that time when we called it love
 But even the sun sets in paradise
 I'm at a payphone trying to call home
 All of my change I spent on you
 Where have the times gone
 Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
 If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
 And all those fairytales are full of shit
 One more fucking love song i'll be sick
 Oh
 You turned your back on tomorrow
 Cause you forgot yesterday
 I gave you my love to borrow
 But you just gave it away
 You can't expect me to be fine
 I don't expect you to care
 I know i've said it before
 But all of our bridges burned down
 I've wasted my nights
 You turned out the lights
 Now i'm paralyzed
 Still stucked in that time when we called it love
 But even the sun sets in paradise
 I'm at a payphone trying to call home
 All of my change I spent on you
 Where have the times gone
 Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
 If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
 And all those fairytales are full of shit
 One more fucking love song i'll be sick
 Now i'm at a payphone...
 Now fuck that shit
 I'll be right here spending all this money while you sitting round
 Wondering why it wasn't you who came out from nothing
 Made it from the bottom
 Now when you see me i'm stunning
 And all of my cars start with a push of a button
 Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
 Switch the number to my phone
 So you never could call it
 Don't need my name on my show
 You can tell it i'm balling
 Swish, what a shame could have got picked
 Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
 So you talk about who you see at the top
 Or what you could've saw
 But sad to say it's over for
 Phantom pulled out valet open doors
 Wiz like go way, got what you was looking for
 Now it's me who they want
 So you can go take that little piece of shit with you
 I'm at a payphone trying to call home
 All of my change I spent on you
 Where have the times gone
 Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
 If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
 And all these fairytales are full of shit
 One more fucking love song i'll be sick
 Now i'm at a payphone
       In the middle of hollywood boulevard
 Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
 Like oh oh oh, can't take it anymore oh oh oh
 Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
 Laughing at each other, laughing at each other, like oh oh oh
 It isn't funny anymore, oh oh
 
 I was the man who never lied
 I never lied until today
 But I just couldn't break your heart
 Like you did mine yesterday
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh, yeah
 
 Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
 Happy ever after, happy ever after
 Let it go, go go, you never need to know, oh oh
 I don't wanna be picking up all of these tiny litle pieces, tiny litle pieces
 Of your heart, oh oh, won't do it anymore, oh oh
 
 I was the man who never lied
 I never lied until today
 But I just couldn't break your heart
 Like you did mine yesterday
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh
 
 I was the....yeah, yeah, oh, oh
 
 In the middle of hollywood boulevard
 What am I doing in hollywood boulevard?
 In the middle of hollywood boulevard
 Screaming at each other, screaming
 
 I was the man who never lied
 I never lied until today
 But I just couldn't break your heart
 Like you did mine yesterday
 
 I was the man who never lied
 I never lied until today
 But I just couldn't break your heart
 Like you did mine yesterday
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh
 I was the man who never lied, oh oh oh
 
 Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
 Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
 Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
 Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
 I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
 So let's get drunk on our tears and
 God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
 It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
 Searching for meaning
 But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
 Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy
 Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
 Don't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrow
 Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
 Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
 Where we're dancing in our tears and
 God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
 It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
 Searching for meaning
 But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
 and I thought I saw you out there crying
 and I thought I heard you call my name
 and I thought I heard you out there crying
 Just the same
 God,give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
 It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
 Searching for meaning
 But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
 And I thought I saw you out there crying
 And I thought I heard you call my name
 And I thought I heard you out there crying
 But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
 Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
 
 You gotta let it go
 Cause we're losing grip now
 It's about to go down
 Would you let me talk to you
 You gotta let me know
 Cause I'm on the edge now
 Of a nerve-breakdown
 Cause I can't get through to you
 I got my hands up screaming
 Got my hands up screaming
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot
 When you get that feeling
 When you get that feeling
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot
 You never let me go
 Got me chained to your touch
 Like a slave for you love
 I'm ashamed to say it's true
 Afraid to let you go
 Cause without you I'm lost
 And not matter the cost
 I'm standing next to you
 I got my hands up screaming
 Got my hands up screaming
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot
 When you get that feeling
 When you get that feeling
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love

 My back's against the world tonight
 So go ahead pull the trigger
 Shoot the lights out
 So go ahead pull the trigger
 Shoot the lights out
 I see the fear that's in your eyes
 So go ahead pull the trigger
 Shoot the lights out
 Go ahead pull the trigger
 Shoot

 Got my hands up screaming
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot
 When you get that feeling
 When you get that feeling
 Don't shoot love baby
 Don't shoot love
 Don't shoot love baby

 But take a chance on me

 Sipping champagne on the beach
 So expensive when she eats

 And now I'm left with nothing

 Because I just can't stand it
 I see her dancing on a fool
 Like she's seventeen and cool
 She really thinks that she can move
 But it's just nasty
 I see her when I go to sleep
 I check my phone when I am weak
 She never posts anything deep
 Cause she's so fancy
 This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
 Fucker

 Chases every star

 Won't you come and put it down on me
 
 
 
 
 
 Unkiss Me - Maroon 5
 If you respect me
 Don't protect me
 
 You can tell me,
 
 I can handle it
 
 Stop pretending,
 
 cause we're going down
 
 If you let go, then just let go
 It's disrespectful
 how you've handled this
 
 Never ending,
 kinda round around
 
 I lie to my heart
 cause I thought you felt it
 You can't light a fire,
 if the candle's melted
 No you don't have to love me
 
 If you don't wanna
 Don't act like I mean nothing
 
 But if you're gonna
 Well, when you're better off
 Unkiss me, untouch me
 
 Untake this heart
 
 And I miss this
 
 Just one thing
 
 A brand new star
 
 Can't erase this, can't delete this
 I don't need this, I can't handle it
 I just feel it, that you're over us
 
 If I wait here, if I see you
 It won't matter,
 what's the point of this?
 We're in pieces,
 
 because you're over us
 
 I lie to my heart
 cause I thought you felt it
 You can't light a fire,
 if the candle's melted
 No you don't have to love me
 
 If you don't wanna
 Don't act like I mean nothing
 
 But if you're gonna
 Well, when you're better off
 Unkiss me, untouch me
 
 Untake this heart
 
 And I miss this
 
 Just one thing
 
 A brand new star
 
 Unkiss me
 
 Unkiss me
 
 So baby let go
 
 Gotta let go
 It's disrespectful
 I can't handle it
 
 Never ending,
 kinda round around
 
 Unkiss me, untouch me
 
 Untake this heart
 
 oh no no no
 
 And I miss this
 
 Just one thing
 
 A brand new star
 
 So unkiss me
 
 So unkiss me
 
 Unkiss me

 Woke up swinging from a dream
 With a different kind of feeling
 All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning
 Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
 We were just wasting time
 For my own life, we never crossed the line
 Only friends in my mind
 But now I realize, it was always you
 Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
 It was always you
 Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
 It was always you, you
 No more saying who
 Looking by now I know it was always you, always you
 All my hidden desires finally came alive
 No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight
 Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
 We were just wasting time
 For my own life, we never crossed the line
 Only friends in my mind
 But now I realize, it was always you
 Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
 It was always you
 Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
 It was always you, you
 No more guessing who
 Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
 Woke up swinging from a tree
 With a different kind of feeling
 It was always you
 Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time
 It was always you
 Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
 It was always you, you
 No more guessing who
 Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
 It was always you
 
       This has not been easy
 this has been hard
 I am scarred
 and I do not know what to do with you.
 go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
 grab your hips, cant remember why i fell in love with this.
  but i miss you, i love you
    its a shame you cant stay away from me this time cause oh no
  you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
  you wont be getting my affection again cause oh no
 i dont need you
 Who do you think you are?
 No one cares about a name without a face,
 so dont go shooting up the place
 make no mistake the loves not real
 cause the love that i got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel
 i dont need you tonight
 it was really nice to know you
 but, theres nothing left to show you
 i got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
 and even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
 Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...
 i miss you, i love you
 you beg me you ask me
  to kiss you and hug you
  you wont be getting my affection again
 cause oh no, i dont need you
 and i miss you, i love you
 you beg me, you ask me to
 cause oh no, I dont need you tonight
       Now as the summer fades
 I let you slip away
 You say I’m not your type
 But I can make you sway
 It makes you burn to learn
 You’re not the only one
 I\'d let you be if you
 put down your blazing gun
 Now you’ve gone somewhere else far away
 I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
 But you feel my breath
 On your neck
 Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 Sometimes you move so well
 It’s hard not to give in
 I’m lost, I can’t tell
 Where you end and I begin
 It makes me burn to learn
 You’re with another man
 I wonder if he’s half
 The lover that I am
 Now you’ve gone somewhere else Far away
 I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
 But you feel my breath On your neck
 Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 Baby, baby
 Please believe me
 Find it in your heart to reach me
 Promise not to leave me behind
 (Promise not to leave me behind)
 Take me down, but take it easy
 Make me think but don’t deceive me
 Talk to me bout taking your time
 (Talk to me, talk to me)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we got much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
       baby, i don't want to spend my life on trial
 for something that i did not do
 and maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
 i wouldn't pass right by you
 maybe it's because you are so insecure
 
 maybe your pain don't care
 
 maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
 i fall so when it's just not there
 
 burn another bridge, break another heart
 try again, it will only fall apart
 infatuation
 
 not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 it's such a shame that you shot me down
 it would have been nice to be around
 i'm touching your skin
 if it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
 i guess this must be infatuation （i want it…）
 try to put my finger on what burns me up
 it always seems to escape me
 and when you have decided that you've had enough
 just tell me where i need to be
 now her face is something that i never had
 to ever deal with before
 she left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
 and i'm the one wanting more
 burn another bridge, break another heart
 try again, it will only fall apart
 infatuation
 
 not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 it's such a shame that you shot me down
 it would have been nice to be around
 i'm touching your skin
 if it's only a  fantasy, then why is it killing me?
 and i guess this must be infatuation （i want it…）
 i'm so attracted to you
 the feeling's mutual too
 and i get scared the moment you leave
 get so hot i forget to breathe, yeh
 infatuation
 
 not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
 it's such a shame that you shot me down
 it would have been nice to be around
 
 i'm touching your skin
 if it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
 i guess this must be infatuation （i want it…）
 ooh （i want it…）
 yeh…（i want it…）
       It's so hard to find you
 I'm standing right behind you
 The streets are much colder
 This mean I'm getting older
 Why would you? How could I?
 These questions lead to goodbye
 But now I got my freedom
 Don't I?
    I parked my car outside your house
    Hope that someday you'll come home
    Seems the woman that I love
    Is someone that I hardly know
    And after all this time
   I finally found a way to be alone
   I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind
 Shy girl, so humble
 With eyes that make me stumble
 Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
 I go out, You eat in
 Hot from the situation
 You're naked in daylight
 Wrap yourself up and goodnight
 I'm burning, I'm hungry
 Angry cuz she don't love me
 You got me completely
 In my own game you beat me
 I'm terrified I think that I may be losing my mind
 I will be back again
 No this is not the end
 I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
 I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
 The tears that you shed
 I'll make it impossible to let go
 I finally found a place to be alone
 Do you mean all the things you are?
 Are you pleased with the way things are?
 Wear that dress to protect this scar
 That only I have seen
 Do you give just to please yourself?
 Do you wish you were somewhere else?
 justified all the things you tried
 Said that it was all for me
 And be near just for the moment
 Stay here never go home
 Did you know
 That everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes
 As the story of a broken heart comes true It comes true
 Have you leared all the secrets yet?
 Were you burned by the things I've said?
 Took the dive just to feel alive
 But never heard the truth
 Now I'm in love but I don't know how
 And I'm in pain cause I want it now
 And as I sit watching her eyes close
 I slowly open mine
 Be near just for the moment
 Stay here, never go home
 Did you know
 That everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes
 As the story of a broken heart comes true comes true
 I am so confused by this
 I know that life is hit or miss
 Days are stung by too much sun
 I think that you may be the one
 Cover yourself up in me
 Shrounded in what could have been
 I will listen to your pain
 If you listen to me
 
 Did you know
 That everything she ever does is for you?
 So it goes
 As the story of a broken heart comes true
 Did you know
 That everything she ever does is for you?
 And I know
 As the story of a broken heart comes true comes true
 True, it comes true, true

 ^_^
 Ooh…
 
 Danced all night slept all day
 Kill us with my heart again
 Feelings when it comes to playing games
 
 You don't cry and you don't care
 Afraid to have a love affair
 
 Is that your ghost or are you really there
 
 Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
 Since you walked out the door
 And now I'm stuck living out that night again
 I'm not falling apart
 Ooh oh
 
 Weather on a sunny day
 Time slows down I wish you'd stayed
 Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
 Mmm
 I try my hardest not to scream
 I find my heart is growing weak
 So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
 
 Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
 Since you walked out the door
 And now I'm stuck living out that night again
 I'm not falling apart
 I heard you say you needed me now
 That's the problem I can't see
 You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
 I'm not falling apart
 
 Take what you want
 And I will be just fine
 
 You'll be better off alone at night
 
 Waiting falling
 
 Constantly calling out your name
 
 Will it ever change
 Now I can't walk I can't talk anymore
 Since you walked out the door
 And now I'm stuck living out that night again
 I'm not falling apart
 I heard you say you needed me now
 That's the problem I can't see
 You destroyed me I won't fall apart again
 I'm not falling apart
 Ohh ooh
 ^_^
       I asked her to stay
 But she wouldn't listen
 She left before I had the chance to say （oh）
 The words that were mend
  The things that were broken
  But now it's far too late she 's gone away
 Every night you cry yourself to sleep
 Thinking "why does this happen to me?
 Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
 Hard to believe it
 It's not over tonight
 Just give me one more chance to make it right
 I may not make it through the night
 I won't go home without you
 The taste of her breath I'll never get over
 And the noises that she made kept me awake (oh)
  The weight of things that remain unspoken
  Built up so much it crushed us everyday
 Every night she cry yourself to sleep
 Thinking "why does this happen to me？
  Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
 Hard to believe it
 It's not over tonight
 Just give me one chance to make it right
 I may not make it through the night
 I won't go home without you
 It's not over tonight
 Just give me one more chance to make it right
 I may not make it through the night
 I won't go home without you
 Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
  Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
 Should not ever let you go oh oh oh
 It's not over tonight
 Just give me one more chance to make it right
 I may not make it through the night
 I won't go home without you（oh）
 It's not over tonight
 Just give me one chance to make it right
 I may not make it through the night
 I won't go home without you
 I won't go home without you
 I won't go home without you
 I won't go home without you
       You left me hanging from a thread
 We once were from together
 I lick my wounds but I can
 Never see them getting better
 Something's gotta change
 Things cannot stay the same
 Her hair was pressed against her face
 Her eyes were ran with anger
 Enraged by things unsaid
 And empty beds and bad behaviour
 Something's gotta change
 It must be rearranged oh
 I'm sorry I did not mean
 To hurt my little girl
 It's beyond me I cannot carry
 The weight of a heavy world
 So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah
 Whoa oh
 The room was silent as we
 All tried so hard to remember
 The way it feels to be alive
 The day that he first met her
 Something's gotta change
 Things cannot stay the same
 You make me think of someone wonderful
 But I can't place her
 I wake up every morning
 Wishing one more time to face her
 Something's gotta change
 It must be rearranged oh
 I'm sorry I did not mean
 To hurt my little girl
 It's beyond me I cannot carry
 The weight of a heavy world
 So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight hope that things work out all right
 So much to love
 So much to learn
 But I won't be there to teach you oh
 I know I can be closed
 But I try my best to reach you
 I'm so sorry I did not mean
 To hurt my little girl
 It's beyond me I cannot carry
 The weight of a heavy world
 So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
 Goodnight hope that things work out all right yeah
 Whoa oh…Yeah…
       i never knew perfection til
 i heard you speak, and now it kills me
 just to hear you say the simple things
 now waking up is hard to do
 and sleeping is impossible too
 everything is reminding me of you
 what can i do?
 it's not right, not ok
 say the words that you say
 maybe we're better off this way?
 i'm not fine, i'm in pain
 it's harder everyday
 maybe we're better off this way?
 it's better that we break…
 a fool to let you slip away
 i chase you just to hear you say
 you're scared and that you think that i'm insane
 the city look so nice from here
 pity i can't see it clearly
 while you're standing there, it disappears
 it disappears
 it's not right, not ok
 say the word it should say
 maybe we're better off this way?
 i'm not fine, i'm in pain
 it's harder everyday
 maybe we're better off this way?
 it's better that we break
 so you sitting all alone
 you're fragile and you're cold, but that's all right
 life these days is getting rough
 they've knocked you down and beat you up
 but it's just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah
 it's not right, not ok
 say the words that you say
 maybe we're better off this way?
 i'm not fine, i'm in pain
 it's harder everyday
 maybe we're better off this way?
 i'm not fine, not ok
 say the words that you say
 maybe we're better off this way?
 i'm not fine, i'm in pain
 it's harder everyday
 maybe we're better off this way?
 it's better that we break, baby

 ^_^
 And  so  do  I,I  empathise
 I  see  you  out,you  never  care
 A  conversation  that  we  never  share
 But  it's  so  strange,it's  something  new
 Amazing  feelings  that  I  have  for  you
 I  close  my  eyes  when  I'm  alone
 Wonder  what  it'd  be  like  to  make  you  moan
 I  wanna  give  you  something  better
 Than  anything  you've  ever  had
 A  stronger  and  a  faster  lover
 The  world  will  disappear  so  fast
 Sweet  kiwi
 Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
 So  please,let  me
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 So  give  it  up,and  don't  pretend
 And  spread  your  arms  and  legs  across  the  bed
 And  when  you  shake,you  won't  regret
 The  things  I  whisper  in  your  ear
 （What?）I  said:
 I  wanna  give  you  something  better
 （You  wanna  give  me  something  better）
 Than  anything  you've  ever  had
 （Than  anything  I've  ever  had）
 A  stronger  and  a  faster  lover
 （A  stronger  and  a  faster  lover）
 The  world  will  disappear  so  fast
 （Will  disappear  so  fast）
 Sweet  kiwi
 Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
 So  please,let  me
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 I  can't  wait  to  take  you  home
 Fingers  through  your  hair
 Kisses  on  your  back
 And  scratch  me  with  your  nails
 Save  me  from  myself
 Show  me  how  to  care
 Get  everything  out
 Dripping  everywhere
 Lipstick  smeared  all  over  your  face
 How  much  longer  must  we  wait?
 …Don't  think  that  I  can  wait
 Sweet  kiwi
 Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin
 So  please,let  me
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins （hey,yeh）
 Sweet  kiwi （wanna  give  you  something  better  than  this）
 Your  juices  dripping  down  my  chin （hey,yeh）
 So  please,let  me （wanna  give  you  something  better  than  this）
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
 Don't  stop  it  before  it  begins
       From the moment the lights went off
 Everything had changed
 Lie awake in an empty room
 In my head, It all feels the same
 like the taste of the day you left
 It still lingers on my breath
 And the dampness of tears that left
 That stain where you had wept
 All alone with the negligee
 That still hangs off of my bed
 I keep meaning to give it away
 But I just leave it there instead
 No need to cry about it
 I can not live without it
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Why do you do this to me?
 You penetrate right through me
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Three more days till I see your face
 I'm afraid, It's far too much
 Cook a meal and fix up the place
 Dial your number, hang it up
 If I took you for granted
 I apologize for acting tough
 You're my reason for living
 And there's no way I'm giving up
 No need to cry about it
 I can not live without it
 Evrey time I wind up back at your door
 Why do you do this to me?
 You penetrate right through me
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Now every evening is a bitter fight
 And I'm eating all alone on a fridy night
 And I know what your friends say
 It's just wasting your love and time
 I will never let you change your mind
 No need to cry about it
 I can not live without it
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Why do you do this to me?
 You penetrate right through me
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 No need to cry about it
 I may just die without it
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 why do you do this to me?
 You penetrate right through me
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 Every time I wind up back at your door
 
 All alone in my room
 think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
 
 I keep looping my memories of you in my head
 I pretend that you want me
 
 And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
 
 And I put myself at ease
 by pretending that she still loves me
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 You'll never go what do I do
 And I can't stop thinking about your love
 
 Ohh yeah
 
 I can't believe I could think
 that she would just follow me everywhere I go
 
 I just wrestle with you in my dreams
 and wake up making love to a pillow
 
 And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
 
 And I put myself at ease
 by pretending that she still loves me
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 You'll never go what do I do
 And I can't stop and I can't stop
 What I would give to have you look in my direction
 
 And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
 
 And I touch myself like it's somebody else
 Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind let me show you
 
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 You'll never go what do I do
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 And I can't stop thinking about you
 You'll never go what do I do
 And I can't stop thinking about you
       I didn't hear what you were saying
 I live on raw emotion baby
 I answer questions never maybe
 And I'm not kind if you betray me
 So who the hell are you to save me
 I never would have made it babe
 If you needed love
 Well then ask for love
 Could have given love
 Now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault
 Coz you both deserve
 What's coming now
 So don't say a word
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here I don't think so
 Would have bled to make you happy
 You didn't need to treat me that way
 And now you beat me at my own game
 And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
 
 And your lover's screaming loudly
 
 I hear a sound and hit the ground
 If you needed love
 Well then ask for love
 Could have given love
 Now I'm taking love
 And it's not my fault
 Coz you both deserve
 What's coming now
 So don't say a word
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here
 I don't feel so bad I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I'm so sorry darling
 Did I do the wrong thing
 Oh what was I thinking
 Is his heart still beating
 Woah oh ohh
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 Come around here I don't feel so bad
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
 Don't you care about me I don't think so
 Six foot tall
 Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
 He won't come around here anymore
 No he won't come around here I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 I don't feel so bad
 Care about me I don't feel so bad
 Wake up call
 Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
 Don't you care about me anymore
       i\'m sick of picking the pieces
 and second-guessing
 my reasons why you don\'t trust me
 why must we do this to one another?
 we are just passionate lovers
 with trouble under the covers
 nothing worse than when
 you know that it\'s over
 i just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to say the words i never said
 just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to show you that i am not dead
 please don\'t leave, stay in bed
 touch my body instead
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 well i\'ve got nothing to hide
 dip down and come for a ride
 i\'m racing the devil, so sly
 you cannot hear him coming
 \'cause my defences are weak
 i have no breath left to speak
 so take my evidence
 and bury it somewhere
 i just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to say the words i never said
 just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to show you that i am not dead
 please don\'t leave, stay in bed
 touch my body instead
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 oh my, i don\'t mind
 being the other guy
 nice try, for these games
 i do not have the time
 if you want me, call me
 come and take a risk （kiss）
 leave somewhere deep under the surface
 i just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to say the words i never said
 just need a little of your time
 a little of your time
 to show you that i am not dead
 please don\'t leave, stay in bed
 touch my body instead
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
 gonna make you feel it
 can you still feel it?
       
 
 Until You're Over Me
 Maroon 5
                  
 This relationship is over,
 though my stomach still hurts.
 And now I'm gonna live alone,
 Why is the pain much worse?
 You're so much better without makeup,
 Why would you hide your face?
 Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
 Realize I've made a big mistake.
  ohhh...
    I can not refuse your eyes,
    Please don't look at me tonight.
    My heart beats fast I know you're there,
 I pretend like I dont care.
  It hurts so bad to know the truth,
     But I am still in love with you.
 I never meant to keep you waiting,
 and now your food is getting cold,
 I keep denying I'm in love with you,
 My routine is getting old.
 And now you stand up from the table,
 And say you never look back.
 do something stupid when you're angry,
 You only wake up sad.
   And I pretend like I dont care.
 It hurts soo much to know the truth,
 No more kisses on your lips, tender touch or speach...
 I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
 And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be??
 And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.
  It hurts too much to know the truth,
       I wake up with blood-shot eyes
 Struggled to memorize
 The way it felt between your thighs
 Pleasure that made you cry
 
 Feels so good to be bad
 Not worth the aftermath' after that
 After that
 Try to get you back
 
 I still don’t have the reason
 And you don’t have the time
 And it really makes me wonder
 If I ever gave a fuck about you
 Give me something to believe in
 Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
 Anymore
 I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
 （Yeah）
 So this is goodbye
 
 Goddamn my spinning head
 Decisions that made my bed
 Now I must lay in it
 And deal with things I left unsaid
 I want to dive into you
 Forget what you’re going through
 I get behind' make your move
 Forget about the truth
 
 I still don’t have the reason
 And you don’t have the time
 And it really makes me wonder
 If I ever gave a fuck about you
 Give me something to believe in
 Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
 Anymore
 I wonder if it even makes a difference'
 It even makes a difference to try
 
 And you talk about how you're feeling
 But I don’t believe it’s true anymore
 Anymore
 I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
 （Oh no）
 So this is goodbye
 
 I’ve been here before
 One day a week
 And it won’t hurt anymore
 
 You caught me in a lie
 I have no alibi
 The words you say don't have a meaning
 Cause
 I still don’t have the reason
 And you don’t have the time
 And it really makes me wonder
 If I ever gave a fuck about you
 And I...and so this is goodbye
 
 Give me something to believe in
 Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
 Anymore
 I wonder if it even makes a difference'
 It even makes a difference to try
 
 And you talk about how you're feeling
 But I don’t believe it’s true anymore
 Anymore
 I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
 （Oh no）
 So this is goodbye
 
 So this is goodbye' yeah （x 3）
 
 
 I miss the taste of a sweeter life
 I miss the conversation
 I’m searching for a song tonight
 I’m changing all of the stations
 I like to think that we had it all
 We drew a map to a better place
 But on that road I took a fall
 Oh baby why did you run away
 I was there for you in your darkest times
 I was there for you in your darkest nights
 But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
 And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
 When all the roads you took came back to me
 So I’m following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 ain't nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 ain't nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following
 I hear your voice in my sleep at night
 Hard to resist temptation
 Cause something strange has come over me
 And now I can’t get over you
 No I just can’t get over you
 I was there for you
 In your darkest times
 I was there for you in your darkest times
 But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
 And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
 When all the roads you took came back to me
 So I’m following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 ain't nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Oh oh oh
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Oh oh
 Oh oh
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In you darkest times
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In your darkest nights
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In you darkest times
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In your darkest nights
 But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
 And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
 When all the roads you took came back to me
 So I’m following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 ain't nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 ain't nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following
       It is so easy to see
 Dysfunction between you and me
 We must free up these tired souls
 Before the sadness kills us both
 I tried and tried to let you know
 I love you but I'm letting go
 It may not last but I don't know
 Just don't know
 If you don't know
 Then you can't care
 And I show up
 But you're not there
 But I'm waiting
 And you want to
 Still afraid that I will desert you
 Everyday
 With every word whispered we get more far away
 The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
 But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
 It hurts but it may be the only way
 A babe that's warm with memories
 Can heal us temporarily
 The misbehaving all he makes
 The ditch between us so damn deep
 Built a wall around my heart
 Never let it fall apart
 Strangely I wish secretly
 It won't fall down while I'm asleep
 If you don't know
 Then you can't care
 And I show up
 But you're not there
 But I'm waiting
 And you want to
 Still afraid that I will desert you babe
 Everyday
 With every word whispered we get more far away
 The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
 But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
 It hurts but it may be the only way
 But we have not hit the ground
 Doesn't mean we're not still falling oh
 I want for mine to pick you up
 But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
 What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
 But until then the fact remains
 Everyday
 With every word whispered we get more far away
 The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
 Nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
 It hurts but it may be the only way
 Everyday
 With every word whispered we get more far away
 The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
 But nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
 It hurts but it may be the only way
 
 
 
 
 
 My Blue Ocean - Maroon 5
 I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story
 
 About this lovely girl who's name was Jane
 
 She was vast and deep and filled with glory
 
 Ah ah ah
 
 Bottom served as home for hull and anchor
 
 She's always fit to quarrel with the wind
 
 The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her
 
 Ah ah ah
 
 Then she heard me
 Say that oath that
 Made everything clear
 
 I love you
 
 My ocean blue
 
 I like the way your sea sees me
 
 My darling Jane
 
 She speaks to me at times through falling rain
 
 Now was time to manifest her vigor
 
 Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
 
 The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger
 
 Ah ah ah
 
 Then she heard me
 Say that oath that
 Made everything clear
 
 I love you
 
 My ocean blue
 
 I like the way your sea sees me
 
 My darling Jane
 
 Oh me, my darling Jane
 
 Oh me and my darling Jane
 
 She speaks to me at times through falling rain
 
 Speaks to me at times through falling rain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 How you're feeling
 When the day has had its way
 With the both of us
 No, I've gone out of my way but I'm not free
 From this pain I'm breathing
 I was a fool to think
 Someday you would come around
 No, no, no, I'm not thinking that way
 Cause now I see you are not what you seem
 You are a mystery to me
 Sometimes I just want to scream
 I think you should just go away cause
 There's no necessity for you to stay
 And next time you come around my way
 Forget it baby, you're not coming in
 
 How's your day been yeah
 Cause mine has taken
 Strange and ugly turns
 But no, no, no, I feel better today
 Cause I'm on my knees
 You are not what you seem, you are a mystery to me
 Sometimes I just want to scream, yeah
 I think you should just go away cause
 There's no necessity for you to stay
 And next time you come around my way
 Forget it baby, you're not coming in
 A heart lived for a life of sorrow
 No you can't come back tomorrow
 Shut my windows lock my doors
 Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more, yeah
 
 I think you should just go away cause
 There's no necessity for you to stay
 And next time you come around my way
 Forget it baby, you're not coming in
 A heart lived for a life of sorrow
 No you can't come back tomorrow
 Shut my windows lock my doors
 Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more
 Ooh...
 Cause my heart won't be your rag doll any more
 
 
 
 
 
 Living easy
 Loving free
 Season ticket for a one way ride
 Asking nothing
 Leave me be
 Takin' everything in my stride
 Don't need reason
 Don't need rhyme
 Ain't nothing I would rather do
 Going down
 Party time
 My friends are gonna be there too
 I'm on a highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 No stop signs
 Speed limit
 Nobody's gonna slow me down
 Like a wheel
 Gonna spinnin'
 Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
 Hey Satan
 Paid my dues
 Playin' in a rocking band
 Hey momma
 Look at me
 I'm on my way to the Promised Land, wooh
 I'm on a highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 
 I'm on the highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 I'm on the highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 
 And I'm going down, wooh
       Now as the summer fades
 I let you slip away
 You say I’m not your type
 But I can make you sway
 It makes you burn to learn
 You’re not the only one
 I\'d let you be if you
 put down your blazing gun
 Now you’ve gone somewhere else far away
 I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
 But you feel my breath
 On your neck
 Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 Sometimes you move so well
 It’s hard not to give in
 I’m lost, I can’t tell
 Where you end and I begin
 It makes me burn to learn
 You’re with another man
 I wonder if he’s half
 The lover that I am
 Now you’ve gone somewhere else Far away
 I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
 But you feel my breath On your neck
 Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 Baby, baby
 Please believe me
 Find it in your heart to reach me
 Promise not to leave me behind
 (Promise not to leave me behind)
 Take me down, but take it easy
 Make me think but don’t deceive me
 Talk to me bout taking your time
 (Talk to me, talk to me)
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 ‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
 And I feel a little better than I did before
 And if I never see your face again
 I don’t mind
 ‘Cause we got much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
 
 The Fog - Maroon 5
 
 Here in this town they have all got the blues
 
 As the paper boy takes off without any news
 
 Angels have wings you can feel free to use
 
 The corner store drugs you can freely abuse
 And I'm yelling and screaming
 Cause baby you're driving me crazy
 
 So life on your own has been vacant and cold
 Everyones getting somewhere
 And you're getting old
 
 Career opportunities
 They all have been sold
 
 Along with your body and most of your soul
 
 And I'm yelling and screaming
 Cause baby you're driving me crazy
 
 If I could spare more remorse
 From my emptied out pores I would maybe
 
 Cause the fogs getting thicker
 The worlds spinning fast
 
 The chaos is building
 It's going too last
 
 And it's so hard to see
 And you're so hard to find
 
 The days when I think
 I am losing my mind
 
 So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
 
 Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
 
 When you start frowning
 They think you're obscene
 
 As you work overtime to make sure they can dream
 
 I'm yelling and screaming
 Cause baby you're driving me crazy
 
 If I could spare more remorse
 From my emptied out pores I would maybe
 
 Cause the fogs getting thicker
 The worlds spinning fast
 The chaos is building  it's going too last
 And it's so hard to see
 And you're so hard to find
 
 The days when I think I am losing my mind
 
 And we yell and we scream
 As the fogs getting thicker
 The worlds spinning fast
 The chaos is building  it's going to last
 
 And it's so hard to see
 And you're so hard to find
 
 The days when I think
 I am losing my mind
 
 And the fogs getting thicker
 The worlds spinning fast
 The chaos is building  it's going to last
 
 And it's so hard to see
 And you're so hard to find
 
 The days when I think I am losing my mind
 Every day, people sway
 Softly lulling me to sleep
 I look the other way
 But I still can't look too deep
 I think I'll fall asleep
 I think I'll fall asleep
 
 So call up and tell him that you will survive
 Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
 You and me and everything's gonna be fine
 
 Every night, people fight
 Gently lulling me to sleep
 What gives me the right
 To waste away and weep
 I think I'll turn away
 There's nothing left to say
 
 So call up and tell him that you will survive
 Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
 You and me and everything's gonna be fine
 
 So you wanna have everything your heart desires
 There's  a fistful of people with their hearts on fire
 Make your way on up to the front of the line
 
 Get out of my way
 I'm here now to stay
 Get out of my way
 I'm here now to stay
 
 So call up and tell him that you will survive
 Good looking kid with the velvet eyes
 You and me and everything's gonna be fine
 So you wanna have everything your heart desires
 There's a fistful of people with their hearts on fire
 Make your way on up to the front of the line
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You let me violate you
 You let me desecrate you
 You let me complicate you
 You let me penetrate you
 Help me I broke apart my insides
 Help me I’ve got no soul to sell
 Help me the only thing that works for me
 Help me get away from myself
 I want to fuck you like an animal
 I want to feel you from the inside
 I want to fuck you like an animal
 My whole existence is flawed
 You get me closer to god
 
 You can have my isolation
 You can have the hate that it brings
 You can have my absence of faith
 You can have my everything
 Help me tear down my reason
 Help me its' your sex I can smell
 Help me you make me perfect
 Help me become somebody else
 I wanna fuck you like an animal
 I wanna feel you from the inside
 I want to fuck you like an animal
 My whole existence is flawed
 You get me closer to god
 
 What am I supposed to do with this time?
 If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
 But I feel out of control
 So petrified, I'm petrified
 
 What am I supposed to do to get by?
 Did I lose everything? I need to survive
 'Cause at 4am, when the sweat sets in
 Did you get my message? did it send?
 Or did you just get on with your life? （Oh）
 
 I'm taking time to thinking I
 Don't think it's fair for us to
 Turn around and say goodbye
 I have this feeling when I
 Finally find the words to say
 But I can't tell you if you turn around and
 Runaway, runaway
 
 What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
 It's my twisted way of keeping you close yeah yeah
 I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
 Did you get my message? did it send?
 Or do get along on your own? oh
 
 I'm taking time to thinking I
 Don't think it's fair for us to
 Turn around and say goodbye
 I have this feeling when I
 Finally find the words to say
 But I can't tell you if you turn around and
 Runaway, runaway
 
 And it breaks me down when I see your face
 You look so different but you feel the same
 And I do not understand
 I cannot comprehend
 The chills your body sends
 Why did it have to end?
 I'm taking time to thinking I
 Don't think it's fair for us to
 Turn around and say goodbye
 I have this feeling when I
 Finally find the words to say
 But I can't tell you if you turn around and
 Runaway, runaway ohh oh
 
 I'm taking time to thinking I
 Don't think it's fair for us to
 Turn around and say goodbye
 And I have this feeling when I
 Finally find the words to say
 But I can't tell you if you turn around and
 Runaway, runaway
 
 Runaway, runaway
 Turn around and
 Runaway, runaway
 
 Runaway, runaway
 But I can't tell you if you
 Runaway, runaway
 Turn around and runaway
 
 
 
 I have told
 All of my enemies
 Very polietly
 To go home
 I have seen
 All of your remedies
 Now won't you let me please
 Go home?
 I can't find anything to be sad about
 They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
 I have tried
 So very hard as hell
 To stay away from hell
 And live upstairs
 But when I see
 All of your remedies
 I try quite desperately
 To go home
 I can't find anything to be sad about
 They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
 But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me
 At least I'll have my health
 I'm trying to control myself
 I have told
 All of my enemies
 Very polietly
 To go home
 I have seen
 All of your remedies
 Now won't you let me please
 Go home?
 I've been acting irresponsibly
 But what could possibly go wrong?
 I have choked on all your remedies
 Now won't you let me please
 Go home?
 But if I sit here lonely
 With no one to hold me
 At least I'll have my health
 I'm trying to control myself
 I'm trying to control
 Myself
 
 
 
 
 
 can you see me
 floating above your head
 as you lay in bed
 thinking about everything
 that you did not do
 cause saying i love you
 has nothing to do with meaning it
 and i don't trust you
 cause every time you're here
 your intentions are unclear
 that i know will never come
 i used to think you were the one
 now i'm sick of thinking anything at all
 you ain't ever coming back to me
 that's not how things were supposed to be
 you take my hand just to give it back
 no other lover has ever done that
 
 do you remember
 the way we used to melt
 do you remember how it felt
 
 when i touched you
 oh cause i remember very well
 
 
 oh oh
 and how long has it been
 since someone you let in
 has given what i gave to you
 
 and at night when you sleep
 
 do you dream i would be there
 just for a minute or two do you
 
 you ain't ever coming back to me
 that's not how things were supposed to be
 
 you take my hand just to give it back
 
 no other lover has ever done that
 heartache heartache i just have so much
 
 a simple love with a complex touch
 
 there is nothing you can say or do
 
 i called to let you know i'm through with you
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 you ain't ever coming back to me
 that's not how things were supposed to be
 
 you take my hand just to give it back
 no other lover has ever done that

 a simple love with a complex touch

 Put your hands all over
 Put your hands all over me
 Put your hands all over
 Put your hands all over me
 I can't seem to find
 The pretty little face I left behind
 Wandered out on the open road
 Looking for a better place to call home
 Gave her a place to stay
 And she got up and ran away
 Well now, I've had enough
 Her pretty little face has torn me up
 Put your hands all over me
 Please talk to me, talk to me
 Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
 Put your hands all over me
 Please walk with me, walk with me now
 Love is a game you say
 Play me and put me away
 Put your hands all over me
 Now you've lost your mind
 The pretty little girl I left behind
 And now you're getting rough
 But everybody knows you're not that tough
 Wandered out on the open road
 Looking for a place to call your own
 Scared to death of the road ahead
 Pretty little thing, don't get upset
 Put your hands all over me
 Please talk to me, talk to me
 Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
 Put your hands all over me
 Please walk with me, walk with me now
 Love is a game you say
 Play me and put me away
 Love is a game you say
 Play me and put me away
 Put your hands all over me
 Put your hands all over me
 Put your hands all over me
 All over me
 So come down off your cloud
 Say it now, say it loud
 Get up in my face
 Pretty little girl, come make my day
 Put your hands all over me
 Please talk to me, talk to me
 Put your hands all over me
 Now walk with me, walk with me now
 Put your hands all over me
 Gotta talk to me, talk to me
 Come on now, babe
 Put your hands all over me
 Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
 Love is a game you say
 Play me and put me away
 Love is a game you say
 Play me and put me away
 Put your hands all over me
 All over me
 Put your hands all over
 Put your hands all over me
 
 
 
 
 
 I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I
 Walked into the living room
 Sit with you' discuss whats going on
 Is it me?
 Is it you?
 Is it something i forgot to do?
 
 Tell me so that i understand
 
 I just need some time
 Gather all my thoughs
 To make up for the love i just lost
 You've been so good to me given me everything
 Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
 I woke up this mornign with the hurting that i would never ever wish upon
 Even my worst enemy
 
 Who is she' what the hell do you people want?
 Is it me?
 Is it you?
 Is it something i forgot to do?
 Tell me so that i understand
 
 I just need some time
 Gather all my thoughs
 To make up for the love i just lost
 You've been so good to me given me everything
 Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway
       You push me,
 I don't have the strength to
 Resist or control you
 So take me down, take me down
 You hurt me,
 But do I deserve this
 You make me so nervous
 Calm me down, calm me down
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
 I will never walk away again
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 So come here and never leave this place
 Perfection of your face
 Slows me down, slows me down
 So fall down
 I need you to trust me
 Go easy, don't rush me
 Help me out
 Why don't you help me out
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
 I will never walk away again
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 So you say go
 It isn't worth it
 And I say no
 It isn't perfect
 So I stay and still
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 I'd give it all away just to get you back
 And fake it, fake it
 I'll take what I can get
 Knocking so loud
 Can you hear me yet?
 Try to stay awake
 But you can't forget
 Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
 I will never walk away again
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 You say go
 It isn't worth it
 And I say no
 It isn't perfect
 So I stay and still
 I'm never gonna leave this bed
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
 Take it, take it all
 Take all that I have
       I watched u cry bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
 U said u wished u did not love me anymore
 U left your flowers in the backseat of my car
 The things we said and did have left permanent scars
 Obsessed depressed at the same time
 I can't even walk in a straight line
 I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
 No sunshine' no sunshine
 She cries
 This is more than goodbye
 When I look into your eyes
 You're not even done
 It's just a feeling just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
 Cuz I can't believe that it's over
 U've hit your low
 U've lost control' u won't come back
 U may not believe me but I gave u all I had
 Oh just confess that you're still mine
 I roll around in a bed full of tears I
 I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
 No sunshine' no sunshine
 She cries
 This is more than goodbye
 When I look into your eyes
 You're not even done
 It's just a feeling just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
 No I can't believe that it's over now
 It's just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 So much to say it's not the way she does her hair
 It's the way she seems and stare right thru my eyes
 And in that darkest day when she refused to run away
 From love she tried so hard to save
 It's just a feeling just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
 It's just a feeling just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 Just a feeling just a feeling that I have
 No I can't believe that it's over now
 It's just a feeling
 Just a feeling that I have
 No I can't believe that it's over No I can't believe that it's over
       I have been searching for your touch
 Unlike any touch I've ever known
 And I never thought about you much
 Till I'm broken down and all alone
 I don't understand the meaning of love
 I do not mind if I die trying
 Took you for granted
 When you lifted me up
 I'm asking for your help
 I am going through hell
 Afraid nothing can save me
 But the sound of your voice
 You cut out all the noise
 And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
 I'd kill if I could take you back
 But how?
 But how?
 I can feel it in my guts
 What's going on with him now
 Don't patronize me with lies
 I'm a man-be-a-woman now
 I have been bound by the shackles of love
 And I don't mind if I die tied up
 Took you for granted
 When you lifted me up
 I'm asking for your help
 I am going through hell
 Afraid nothing can save me
 But the sound of your voice
 You cut out all the noise
 And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
 I'd kill if I could take you back
 But how?
 But how?
 But how?
 But how?
 Why must we be so ugly
 And please do not stick up on me
 Why does the one you love
 Become the one who makes you want to die
 Why?
 Why?
 Why?
 I don't understand the meaning of love
 I do not mind if I die trying
 I do not mind if I die trying
 I do not mind if I die trying
 Tell me actions speak louder
 But there's something about her words that hurt
 
 Clothes on the bed, so late and
 I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door
 
 On our way home I realise
 
 There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
 
 Only veiled by a thin disguise
 
 Now that I've done my time
 I need to move on and I need you to try
 
 Cos we're out of goodbyes
 
 We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes
 
 Never asked you to change
 But sadly you don't feel the same about me
 
 I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
 Like this man
 On our way home I realise
 
 There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
 
 Only veiled by a thin disguise
 
 Now that I've done my time
 
 I need to move on and I need you to try
 
 Cos we're out of goodbyes
 
 We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes
       Get Back in My Life
 Maroon 5
 
 You are relentless, I am defenseless
 Why did you knock me down tonight?
 
 You keep me senseless, I just don't get this
 How many times do I have to try?
 
 Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
 Cause I'll fall into the darkness,
 it's impossible to express
 How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
 So entitled, I'll never be free
 Oh, I don't fight the feeling
 
 Get back in my life, come knock on my door
 What I looking for? I think you should know
 You started a fight, put me to the floor
 Please don't resist anymore
 I'll never leave you alone
 
 Beauty from many, you're so demanding
 But I've got time, I don't mind at all
 You're picture perfect, completely worthy
 You got my back against my wall
 
 Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
 Cause I fall into the darkness,
 impossible to express
 How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
 So entitled, I'll never be free (yeah)
 Oh, I don't fight the feeling
 
 Get back in my life, come knock on my door
 What I looking for? I think you should know
 You started a fight, put me to the floor
 Please don't resist anymore
 I'll never leave you alone
 
 And can you hear me calling?
 I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
 You ignore me cause I'm always
 Coming back to you, coming back to you
 And you know how much I miss it
 And you know I can't resist it
 See your lips and just come running
 Running back to you, running back to you
 Get back in my life, come knock on my door
 What I looking for? I think you should know
 You started a fight, put me to the floor
 I can't do this anymore
 I'll never leave you alone
 Get back in my life,
 come knock
 
 I'll never leave you alone
 
       I must have been a fool
 To love you so hard for so long
 So much stronger than before
 But so much harder to move on
 
 And now the bitter chill of the winter
 Still blows through me like a plague
 Only to wake up with an empty bed
 On a perfect summer day
 
 My world just feels so cold
 And you find yourself
 Walking down the wrong side of the road
 
 I can't lie on my mind
 Stuck inside my head
 I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
 I just die so much inside
 Now that you're not there
 I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
 
 I never did my best to
 Express how I really felt
 And now that I know exactly what I want
 You found somebody else
 
 My, my world just feels so cold
 And you find yourself
 Walking on the wrong side of the road
 
 I can't lie on my mind
 Stuck inside my head
 I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
 I just die so much inside
 Now that you're not there
 I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
 
 My world just feels so cold
 And I find myself
 Thinking about the things I could have done
 And it warms my soul
 When you let me know
 I'm not the only one
 
 I can't lie on my mind
 Stuck inside my head
 I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
 I just die so much inside
 Now that you're not there
 I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
 
 I can't lie on my mind
 Stuck inside my head
 I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
 I just die so much inside
 Now that you're not there
 I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
 
 I can't lie on my mind
 Stuck inside my head
 I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah...
